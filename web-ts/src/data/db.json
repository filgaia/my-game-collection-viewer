                "description": "After the events of Batman: Arkham Asylum (2009), a section of the city of Gotham has been turned into a prison, designed to keep the scum of the city away from the people. Bruce Wayne protests this prison but is shortly kidnapped by the despicable Hugo Strange, thus having to face the city's most powerful villains as the Batman while trying to uncover Strange's plans.\n\nStoryline:\nAt a press conference held by Bruce Wayne to declare his opposition to Arkham City, TYGER mercenaries arrest and imprison him in Arkham City. Hugo Strange discloses his knowledge of Wayne's dual identity as Batman before releasing him into the prison's criminal populace. While Strange prepares to commence \"Protocol 10\", Wayne obtains his equipment via airdrop from Alfred Pennyworth, allowing him to become Batman. He first saves Catwoman from being executed by Two-Face, who hopes to gain respect by murdering her. After Joker attempts to assassinate Catwoman, Batman tracks him to his hideout in the Sionis Steelmill, believing Joker may know the truth behind Protocol 10.\n\nThere, Batman learns that the unstable properties of the Titan formula are mutating in Joker's blood, gradually killing him. Joker captures Batman and performs a blood transfusion on him, infecting him with the same fatal disease. Joker also reveals that Gotham hospitals have been poisoned with his infected blood. Desperate to save himself and innocent citizens, Batman seeks out Mr. Freeze, who had been developing a cure but has since been kidnapped by the Penguin.\n\nTracking Penguin to the Cyrus Pinkney National History Institute, Batman defeats his forces, his imprisoned monster Solomon Grundy, and ultimately the Penguin himself, before liberating Mr. Freeze. Freeze tells Batman that he has already developed the cure, but its instability renders it useless. Batman deduces that the restorative properties of Ra's al Ghul's blood can complete the cure. Batman tracks one of Ra's al Ghul's assassins to his underground lair, leading Batman into a confrontation with Ra's and his daughter Talia, Batman's former lover. With Ra's al Ghul's blood, Freeze is able to develop an antidote, but it is stolen by Harley Quinn before Batman can use it.\n\nWhen he returns to the Joker, Batman finds him restored to health. While the two fight, Strange activates Protocol 10, which is revealed to be a scheme to wipe out the entire population of Arkham City and destroy the criminal element of Gotham. The TYGER troops begin executing inmates as Strange launches missile strikes on Arkham's denizens from his base in Wonder Tower. A missile hits the steelmill, burying Batman under rubble. Before Joker can take advantage of the situation, Talia arrives and offers him immortality in exchange for sparing Batman's life. After escaping with the help of Catwoman, Batman is convinced by Alfred to end Protocol 10 before pursuing Talia and Joker.\n\nBatman infiltrates Wonder Tower and disables Protocol 10. Ra's al Ghul is revealed to be the true mastermind behind Arkham City and mortally wounds Strange for failing to defeat Batman. With his dying breath, Strange activates \"Protocol 11\", the self-destruction of Wonder Tower. Batman and Ra's escape, but Ra's commits suicide rather than risk capture. Joker contacts Batman, threatening to kill Talia unless Batman meets him at the Monarch Theater. Once Batman arrives, Joker demands the cure but is stabbed and apparently killed by Talia while distracted. Talia admits to stealing the cure from Quinn, when she is killed by a second Joker, still stricken with the disease. The healthy Joker that Talia stabbed then reanimates into the shapeshifting Clayface, who is revealed to have been masquerading as a healthy Joker all along at the ailing villain's request.\n\nBatman incapacitates Clayface, but Joker blows up the theater floor, sending Batman plummeting into Ra's' lair below. Batman destroys Ra's' rejuvenating Lazarus Pit before the Joker can use it, and drinks a portion of the antidote. Batman debates curing his foe but is attacked by Joker before he can act, causing the antidote vial to inadvertently smash. Batman admits that in spite of everything Joker had done, he would have saved him. After Joker finally succumbs to his illness and dies, Batman carries his body out of Arkham City. As Commissioner Gordon asks what happened, Batman places Joker's body on the hood of a police car and leaves in silence.",

Regain control of a futuristic Tokyo from an emerging robotic threat in the year 2080. The story starts when Dan Marshall and his squad are sent to bring the robotic community under control as they begin to infiltrate society and slowly take over undetected, leaving humans redundant in their wake. Fighting through the derelict lower levels of the city, players control an international peace-keeping squad that soon starts to question their surroundings and the choices they make. Are the robots becoming more human, or are humans becoming more like machines?\n\nThrilling encounters with these highly intelligent robotic enemies require you to think tactically, make challenging, real-time moral decisions and build up trust with your team mates in order to guide your squad to safety and success.\n\nStoryline:\nIn the late 20th century, global warming consumes 75% of the world habitable land, forcing mankind to build new, raised cities above those that are now claimed by the sea. But the flooding has not only claimed land. Millions of people have been killed as well, leaving humanities workforce severely depleted and as a result, have created a robotic workforce to handle the workload. To govern how this robotic workforce is treated, the UN creates the \"New Geneva Convention\", part of which is clause 21, which forbids robots that can pass as humans from being created, which are dubbed \"hollow children\" by the population. To enforce clause 21, the UN creates specialist R.U.S.T crews. When a hollow child breaks into the headquarters of robotics company Bergen, after discovering he is a hollow child and having lived his life believing himself to be human, the UN suspect the Amada corporation to be behind its creation. As a result, a R.U.S.T crew is dispatched to bring Amada's CEO before the UN security council to give answers.",

                "description": "Five years after the events of Borderlands, a valuable mineral called \"Eridium\" starts flourishing through Pandora's crust. Handsome Jack, the leader of the Hyperion Corporation, secures this new resource and uses it to rule over Pandora with an iron fist. Meanwhile, rumors of an even larger Vault hidden on Pandora spread across the galaxy, drawing a new group of Vault Hunters to the planet in search of it.\n\nStoryline:\nThe opening cutscene introduces the four new Vault Hunters as they ride a train on Pandora. However, the train is a trap set by Handsome Jack, and it explodes. The Vault Hunters regain consciousness in a frozen wasteland and are found by the last remaining Hyperion CL4P-TP (\"Claptrap\") unit. The Guardian Angel contacts the Vault Hunters and instructs them to accompany Claptrap to the city of Sanctuary, and to join the Crimson Raiders, an anti-Hyperion resistance movement, in order to defeat Handsome Jack. Claptrap and the Vault Hunters are able to escape the frozen wastes after defeating Captain Flynt, the local bandit leader, and retaking Claptrap's boat. Along the way, Handsome Jack taunts the Vault Hunters, while the Guardian Angel offers advice and comfort.\nUpon arriving at the gates of Sanctuary, the Vault Hunters are asked to rescue Roland, now leader of the Crimson Raiders, who has been captured by a bounty hunter called the Firehawk. The Vault Hunters meet the Firehawk, who turns out to be Lilith(an existing and playable character in Borderlands), whose powers as a siren have been significantly enhanced by the new supply of eridium. Lilith informs the Vault Hunters that Roland was actually captured by a group of bandits. After fighting through the bandits' territory, the Vault Hunters rescue Roland and return to Sanctuary.\nRoland and Lilith learn that the Vault Key is being transported aboard a Hyperion train, and task the Vault Hunters to retrieve it. To accomplish the mission, the Vault Hunters enlist the aid of former Vault Hunter Mordecai, and of Tiny Tina, a psychotic explosives-obsessed thirteen-year-old. The Vault Hunters derail the train, but instead of finding the Vault Key, they encounter Wilhelm, a powerful Hyperion cyborg. After Wilhelm's defeat, the Vault Hunters recover his power core, which Roland recommends be used as the power source for Sanctuary's shields. The power core turns out to be a trap; it allows the Guardian Angel, who is actually working for Jack, to lower the city's shields and render it vulnerable to a bombardment from the Hyperion moon satellite. Lilith saves Sanctuary, which was originally a large spacecraft, by activating its engines and teleporting it away; for the rest of the game, Sanctuary exists as a flying city in the sky.\nJack's true plan is revealed: to open Pandora's second Vault and unleash The Warrior, a powerful lava, eridium, and rock creature controlled by whomever releases it. Additionally, he is forcing Angel to help him charge the Vault Key more quickly than usual. Angel communicates with the group in Sanctuary, and despite hostile treatment from Roland, divulges that the Vault Key is kept with her in a Hyperion facility. She also shares information about the formidable defenses of the facility. The Vault Hunters embark upon a series of missions in order to assemble what is needed to overcome these defenses, including obtaining an upgrade for Claptrap, visiting the Hyperion city of Opportunity, and enlisting the aid of Brick, now leader of the Slab clan of bandits. During the process, Mordecai's pet bird Bloodwing is captured and killed by Handsome Jack; a grief-stricken Mordecai vows revenge and joins the other three former Vault Hunters at Sanctuary. Roland and the Vault Hunters assault the Hyperion compound and meet Angel, who is not only a real person, but a siren, and Handsome Jack's daughter. She requests to be killed in order to stop her father from charging the Vault Key and gaining control of The Warrior. Handsome Jack sends in waves of security forces in order to protect his daughter, but ultimately, Roland and the Vault Hunters, with the help of late arrival Lilith, successfully kill Angel. An enraged Handsome Jack teleports in, kills Roland, and captures Lilith, whom he forces to resume charging the Vault Key in Angel's stead. Lilith manages to teleport the Vault Hunter out of the facility and back to Sanctuary.\nMordecai and Brick decide to learn the location of the second Vault and confront Handsome Jack and The Warrior. While the Vault Hunters travel to the Hyperion Information Annex and obtains the Vault's location, the two steal a Hyperion ship. The Vault Hunters approach on foot, battling elite Hyperion security forces, while Brick and Mordecai are shot down but left alive. Ultimately, the Vault Hunters confront, battle, and defeat Handsome Jack himself, but arrive too late to prevent him from opening the Vault. Handsome Jack summons The Warrior, a gargantuan dragon-like lava creature, and orders it to kill the Vault Hunters. After a long battle, the Vault Hunters defeat the Warrior, and executes Handsome Jack in the aftermath.\nBrick and Mordecai arrive just as Lilith attempts to destroy the Vault Key. However, she accidentally activates a secret information bank containing a huge map of the galaxy with several Vaults marked on it. Lilith remarks that \"there ain't no rest for the wicked\" before the screen fades to black.",

The game features ridiculous violence, pixel art graphics and a fully destructible Vietnam setting. While masquerading as a run ‘n gun in the vein of Metal Slug, Broforce’s reactive environment encourages tactical play. Each bro out of the 13 the game currently features has distinctive overpowered attacks and special abilities, and mastering them all is one of Broforce’s core pleasures. Death is instant and can be surprising, but this is balanced by the incompetence of the enemy. Explosions are plentiful and very often result in chaotic chain reactions, but this shouldn’t discourage you from permanently holding down your trigger finger. Yelling “‘Murica!” while you do so is optional.\nBroforce is best played co-operatively, two to four players (though single player is an option). It can be played both on keyboard and on XBox controllers.\nVehicular action sequences, dinosaurs, aliens and epic Contra-inspired boss fights, deathmatch arenas with leaderboards and rankings, a level editor, the ability to challenge friends and share custom levels, a customizable Brofort with unlockable rooms and much more to come in the full game. The only thing left to say is: brace your loins.",

It turns out they did.\n\nAnd ever since day one, 2 Player Productions has been recording the whole process in an ongoing series of in-depth episodes documenting the creation of a game.

The game was developed by MercurySteam and published by Konami. This is MercurySteam's last contribution to the franchise. The story is set in both medieval and modern worlds.\n\nAs in the previous game, the player controls Gabriel Belmont, now known as Dracula, as he fights through an open world. During the game's opening sequence the player is able to control Dracula while he still possesses all his powers as well as all of his weapons. Dracula's main weapon is his Blood Whip, a weapon that is comparable to the Combat Cross from the original Lords of Shadow. Replacing the magic system from the previous game are the Void Sword and the Chaos Claws. The Void Sword can replenish Dracula's health when used while the Chaos Claws can be used to break through enemy defenses and deliver powerful attacks. The story mode in Lords of Shadow 2 has been stated to be far longer than the previous one. The game is mainly an open world allowing the player to choose what route to take. This game also features a movable camera, something that was not available in the first Lords of Shadow game.\n\nStoryline:\nDracula (Gabriel) awakens many years after the events of the previous Lords of Shadow title. He has been warned by Zobek of the return of Satan and sets out to regain his powers so that he may face Satan once again. The key to him regaining his power lies in his castle. However, the famed Belmont clan and his son Alucard seek his ultimate destruction.",

                "description": "For the last twelve months, we’ve had our heads down working hard on Everybody’s Gone to the Rapture and it’s really exciting to be able to share some more information with you as well as a new trailer.\n\nIf you already know The Chinese Room, you’ll know that we make story-driven games. Creating a rich, deep world with strong drama and exceptional production values is key to what we’re all about. Rapture is set in a remote valley in June 1984 and is a story about people and how they live with each other. But it’s also about the end of the world. \n\nRapture is inspired by the fiction of John Wyndham, J. G. Ballard, John Christopher and other authors who deal with ordinary people in extraordinary circumstances. There’s a very particular English feel that we wanted to capture in the game, a combination of the epic and the intimate. Rapture also came from our obsession with post-apocalyptic gaming, and the simple idea that whilst we normally play as the hero, in reality, most of us would be the piles of ash and bone littering the game world. That’s an interesting place to start telling a story.\n\nOur approach is to create a game that you can utterly immerse yourself in. Yaughton Valley, where Rapture takes place, is a living, breathing world. The world of Rapture is not just a backdrop; it’s a character in its own right. It’s great working with PS4 as its processing power makes a game like this possible for a team our size.\n\nThe game is all about discovery. It’s open-world so you have the freedom to explore wherever you like, visiting areas in an order you define, and the story is written to allow this whilst making sure every player has a strong dramatic experience. It’s a type of storytelling that is completely unique to games. The choices you make as a player have a direct impact on how you understand the story – the more you explore and interact, the deeper you are drawn into Rapture’s world.\n\nStoryline:\nEverybody’s Gone to the Rapture tells the story of the inhabitants of a remote English valley who are caught up in world-shattering events beyond their control or understanding. Made by The Chinese Room -- the studio responsible for the hauntingly beautiful Dear Esther -- this tale of how people respond in the face of grave adversity is a non-linear, open-world experience that pushes innovative interactive storytelling to the next level. This story begins with the end of the world.",

Unravel the mystery for yourself in Gone Home, a story exploration game from The Fullbright Company. \n\nGone Home is an interactive exploration simulator.

Meet Manny Calavera, travel agent at the Department of Death. He sells luxury packages to souls on their four-year journey to eternal rest. But there's trouble in paradise. Help Manny untangle himself from a conspiracy that threatens his very salvation.\n\nStoryline:\nThe game is divided into four acts, each taking place on November 2 on four consecutive years. Manuel \"Manny\" Calavera is a travel agent at the Department of Death in the city of El Marrow, forced into his job to work off a debt \"to the powers that be\". Manny is frustrated with being assigned clients that must take the four-year journey and is threatened to be fired by his boss, Don Copal, if he does not come up with better clients. Manny steals a client, Mercedes \"Meche\" Colomar, from his co-worker Domino Hurley. The Department computers assign Meche to the four-year journey even though Manny believes she should have a guaranteed spot on the \"Number Nine\" luxury express train due to her pureness of heart in her life. After setting Meche on her way, Manny investigates further and finds that Domino and Don have been rigging the system to deny many clients Double N tickets, hoarding them for the boss of the criminal underworld, Hector LeMans. LeMans then sells the tickets at an exorbitant price to those that can afford it. Manny recognizes that he cannot stop Hector at present and instead, with the help of his driver and speed demon Glottis, he tries to find Meche on her journey in the nearby Petrified Forest. During the trip Manny encounters Salvador \"Sal\" Limones, the leader of the small underground organization Lost Souls Alliance (LSA), who is aware of Hector's plans and recruits Manny to help. Manny arrives at the small port city of Rubacava and finds that he has beaten Meche there, and waits for her to show up.\n\nA year passes, and the city of Rubacava has grown. Manny now runs his own nightclub off a converted automat near the edge of the Forest. Manny learns from Olivia Ofrenda that Don has been \"sprouted\" for letting the scandal be known and that Meche was recently seen with Domino leaving the port. Manny gives chase and a year later tracks them to a coral mining plant on the Edge of the World. Domino has been holding Meche there as a trap to lure Manny. All of Domino's clients who had their tickets stolen are also being held there and used as slave labor, both to make a profit with the coral mining and as a way to keep Hector's scandal quiet. Domino tries to convince Manny to take over his position in the plant seeing as he has no alternative and can spend the rest of eternity with Meche but he refuses. After rescuing Meche, Manny defeats Domino by causing him to fall into a rock crusher. Manny, along with Meche, Glottis and all the souls being held at the plant then escape from the Edge of the World.\n\nThe three travel for another year until they reach the terminus for the Number Nine train before the Ninth Underworld. Unfortunately, the Gate Keeper to the Ninth Underworld won't let the souls progress without their tickets, mistakenly believing they have sold them. Meanwhile, Glottis has fallen deathly ill. Manny learns from demons stationed at the terminus that the only way to revive Glottis is to travel at high speeds to restore Glottis' purpose for being summoned. Manny and the others devise a makeshift fuel source to create a \"rocket\" train cart, quickly taking Manny and Meche back to Rubacava and saving Glottis' life. The three return to El Marrow, now found to be fully in Hector's control and renamed as Nuevo Marrow. Manny regroups with Sal and his expanded LSA and with the help of Olivia, who volunteered to join the gang earlier in Rubacava, and is able to learn about Hector's current activities. Further investigation reveals that Hector not only has been hoarding the Number Nine tickets, but has created counterfeit versions that he has sold to others. Manny tries to confront Hector but is lured into another trap by Olivia, who has also captured Sal, and is taken to Hector's greenhouse to be sprouted. Manny is able to defeat Hector after Sal sacrifices himself to prevent Olivia from interfering. Manny and Meche are able to find the real Double N tickets, including the one that Meche should have received. Manny makes sure the rest of the tickets are given to their rightful owners; in turn, he is granted his own for his good deeds. Together, Manny and Meche board the Number Nine for their happy journey to the Ninth Underworld.",

                "description": "Ico (イコ Iko?, /ˈiːkoʊ/) is an action-adventure game developed by Team Ico and published by Sony Computer Entertainment, released for the PlayStation 2 video game console in 2001 and 2002 across various regions. It was designed and directed by Fumito Ueda, who wanted to create a minimalist game around a \"boy meets girl\" concept. Originally planned for the PlayStation, Ico took approximately four years to develop. The team employed a \"subtracting design\" approach to reduce elements of gameplay that interfered with the game's setting and story in order to create a high level of immersion.\n\nThe protagonist is a young boy named Ico who was born with horns, which his village considers a bad omen. Warriors lock him away in an abandoned fortress. During his explorations of the fortress, Ico encounters Yorda, the daughter of the castle's Queen. The Queen plans to use Yorda's body to extend her own lifespan. Learning this, Ico seeks to escape the castle with Yorda, keeping her safe from the shadow-like creatures that attempt to draw her back. Throughout the game, the player controls Ico as he explores the castle, solves puzzles and assists Yorda across obstacles.\n\nIco introduced several design and technical elements, including a story told with minimal dialog, bloom lighting and key frame animation, that have influenced subsequent games. Although not a commercial success, it was critically acclaimed for its art and story elements and received several awards, including \"Game of the Year\" nominations and three Game Developers Choice Awards. Ico is listed on several overall top game lists, and is often considered a work of art. The game was reprinted in Europe in 2006, in conjunction with the release of Shadow of the Colossus, the spiritual successor to Ico. Along with Shadow of the Colossus, Ico was released in The Ico &amp; Shadow of the Colossus Collection for the PlayStation 3 which featured high-definition graphics and 3D support. This HD version was released separately as a retail version in Japan.\n\nStoryline:\nIco (イコ Iko?), a horned boy, is taken by a group of warriors to an abandoned castle and locked inside a stone coffin to be sacrificed. A tremor topples the coffin and Ico escapes. As he searches the castle, he comes across Yorda (ヨルダ Yoruda?), a captive girl who speaks a different language. Ico helps Yorda escape and defends her from shadow-like creatures. The pair make their way through the castle and arrive at the bridge leading to land. As they cross, the Queen, ruler of the castle, appears and tells Yorda that as her daughter she cannot leave the castle. The Queen destroys part of the bridge; although Yorda tries to save him, Ico falls off the bridge and loses consciousness.\n\nIco awakens below the castle and makes his way back to the upper levels, finding a magic sword that dispels the shadow creatures. After discovering that Yorda has been turned to stone by the Queen. He confronts the Queen in her throne room, who reveals that she plans to restart her life anew by taking possession of Yorda's body. Ico slays the Queen with the magic sword, but with her death the castle begins to collapse around him; he is hit by falling debris, breaking his horns, and he falls unconscious. The Queen's spell on Yorda is broken, and a shadowy Yorda carries Ico safely out of the castle to a boat, sending him to drift to the shore alone. Ico awakens to find the distant castle in ruins, and Yorda, in her human form, washed up nearby. She stirs.",

The second episode, Rubble Without a Cause, was released on December 12, 2015.\n\nThe game can be bought by either buying the first episode and afterwards a season pass or a a complete collection including all episodes, which is set to feature an exclusive epilogue.\n\nThere have been a lot of attempts of making a new King's Quest game since Mask of Eternity, but this is the first official one to actually come out since.\n\nThe game's story is told through flashbacks narrated by King Graham of Daventry, who is telling his granddaughter of his life.\n\nGameplay\n\nThe game is a modern take on the classic adventure game genre. There are various puzzles often using different items stored in the player's inventory to solve them, as well as dialogue trees in conversations.\n\nAt times the player is presented with a story choice that leads to different outcomes and changes the way King Graham's granddaughter Gwendolyn behaves in cutscenes.\n\nThe game also features some action scenes (like shooting a bow and arrow or sneaking past obstacles) and a few quick time events.\n\nVarious instant death scenes, a staple of the King's Quest series, make a return in the game too. The \"deaths\" are always alluded to never have actually taken place by Graham's narration.\n\nStory\n\nAn aged King Graham tells his young granddaughter Gwendolyn of all his greatest adventures.\n\nChapter 1: A Knight to Remember\n\nThe first story tells how Graham, then a knight, retrieved the famous Magic Mirror, which eventually led to him becoming king, from a dragon's cave.\n\nThe second story jumps back in time and tells how a very young Graham tried to become a Knight of Daventry in the first place, by taking place in a Knight Tournament. Graham has to beat various famous knights from all around the land in competitions of strength, speed and wit to accomplish this deed.\n\nIn the present time, Gwendolyn meets her slightly, arrogant, older cousin Gart and tells him that she will take part in the same fencing tournament held in the castle as him. Between listening to her grandfather's stories she trains for the tournament and eventually winds up fighting Gart.\n\nChapter 2: Rubble Without a Cause\n\n",

The adventure takes place deep in the deserts of Egypt, where an ancient Temple to Set has just been discovered. Set, the god of chaos, once ruled all of Egypt after murdering his brother Osiris and enslaving the other gods, but when Egypt was no longer enough, he vanished into the land of the dead intent on raising an army that could conquer the world, but he never returned.\n\nLara Croft, famed explorer, thought she would be first to arrive at the temple, but up-and-coming archeologist Carter Bell beat her to the entrance. They each hoped to find the mythical Staff of Osiris, but they discovered more than they bargained for.\n\nThe Temple was a prison for Horus and Isis, the last of the old gods not bound to Set. Seeing the Staff, Carter removed it from a mechanism, setting off the trap meant to keep Horus and Isis imprisoned. Lara and Carter now find themselves marked for death. Horus and Isis, freed from thousands of years in prison and in possession of the staff, promise Carter and Lara they will help them resurrect Osiris, the only god capable of saving Lara and Carter from judgment, and the only power that can hope to defeat Set. With a common goal of finding the fragments of Osiris, and stopping the return of Set, the companions form an alliance.\n\nAs they fight their way across the sands, they must face gods and monsters of myth and legend driven mad and controlled by Set. At stake is the fate of the world, as Set marshals his powers in order to return and reclaim his throne in the world of the living, with an army of the dead behind him. Set knows the prophecy has come, intent on remaking the world in his own image, a nightmare of storms and death.\n\nCritically Acclaimed Franchise\nSequel to the critically acclaimed Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light, one of the best-selling digital titles of all time.\n\nClassic Arcade Action\nFirst ever 4 player co-op multiplayer experience featuring Lara Croft. Have your friends play as Carter, Isis, and Horus while you play as Lara in the fully cooperative story mode – offline and online supported.\n\nCompetitive Co-op\nCompete against your friends to earn bigger rewards, weapons unlocks, and artifacts to boost your character. Will you work together or will you sacrifice your friends for a higher score?\n\nNext Gen Experience\nStunning visuals with no load-times and hundreds of relics, weapons, and artifacts to discover.",

His weapon of choice is his shotgun. He is assisted by another man called Chumbucket. Chum mainly works with Max to build and upgrade the Magnum Opus vehicle.\n\nMad Max will feature a variety of weapons which Max can use to defeat enemies. Though the shotgun is Max's weapon of choice, ammo is scarce, and so melee options are the smarter way to go. The 'thunderstick' is an explosive weapon that can be lanced into an enemy's chest, crackling like a lit dynamite fuse before blowing the victim to smithereens. The Harpoon is also one of Max's favorite weapon though it can only be used in-vehicle with Chum riding along. Max's Magnum Opus can be combined with a speedy V12 engine and powerful ramming ability to destroy enemies's vehicles and weaponry. When simultaneously driving and aiming, the game enters slow-motion and allows you to toggle between targets. Not much is known about the vehicular combat and its features.\n\nMad Max will feature crafting system which can be used to craft new weapons and tools. Max's garage can also be used to change and modify the car's engines, chassis, wheels, body works including paint treatment and the “shell” of the auto-mobile and the car’s weight and attributes update accordingly. Max can also be upgraded though it's plans hasn't fully been implemented.\n\nMany choices are given in the game, such as, either playing silently or aggressively. Max can also get guidance from Chum about how he can complete his objectives strategically. However, its largely up to the player how he can complete the objectives.\n\nStoryline:\nMax must traverse a barren desert wasteland in search for his lost treasured vehicle, the Pursuit Special (also referred to as The Interceptor).",

The player does so by placing Tetromino pieces, which the mice can climb onto and walk on top of. All of this is being watched in the background by a mad-scientist-looking cat.\n\nThe \"test subjects\" themselves move much in a Lemmings-like fashion: they walk straight until reaching a ledge they can't jump onto, at which point they turn around. They may climb one block up and fall three down. Later on more types of blocks are introduced, such as jelly blocks breaking the fall, crumbling blocks withstanding only as many as two walks across them or dynamite blocks exploding and destroying other blocks in a one-block radius.\n\nSystem Requirements\n\nPC\n\nMinimum\n\nOS: Windows XP SP2 or laterProcessor: 1.6Ghz or HigherMemory: 1 GB RAMGraphics: OpenGL 2.0 compatible video card with 256 MB shared or dedicated RAM (ATI or NVIDIA)DirectX: Version 9.0cHard Drive: 700 MB available space\n\nRecommended\n\nOS: Windows XP SP2 or laterProcessor: 1.6Ghz or HigherMemory: 2 GB RAMGraphics: OpenGL 2.0 compatible video card with 512 MB shared or dedicated RAM (ATI or NVIDIA)DirectX: Version 9.0cHard Drive: 1 GB available space\n\nMac\n\nMinimum\n\nOS: 10.6 Snow Leopard or laterProcessor: Intel MacMemory: 1 GB RAMGraphics: OpenGL 2.0 compatible video card with 256 MB shared or dedicated RAM (ATI or NVIDIA)Hard Drive: 700 MB available space\n\nRecommended\n\nOS: 10.6 Snow Leopard or laterProcessor: Intel MacMemory: 2 GB RAMGraphics: OpenGL 2.0 compatible video card with 512 MB shared or dedicated RAM (ATI or NVIDIA)Hard Drive: 1 GB available space\n\nLinux\n\nMinimum\n\nOS: Ubuntu 12.04 32-bit or Ubuntu 12.10 32-bitMemory: 1 GB RAMGraphics: OpenGL 2.0 compatible video card with 256 MB shared or dedicated RAM (ATI or NVIDIA)Hard Drive: 700 MB available space\n\nRecommended\n\nOS: Ubuntu 12.04 32-bit or Ubuntu 12.10 32-bitMemory: 2 GB RAMGraphics: OpenGL 2.0 compatible video card with 512 MB shared or dedicated RAM (ATI or NVIDIA)Hard Drive: 1 GB available space",

                "description": "Overview\n\nPinballistik is a PSN-exclusive title featuring several innovations:\n\nBattle mode - Two-player simultaneous competitions.AI pinball players - You can play against either another human player or the AI.Havok Physics - The ball and flipper physics are authentically modeled using the award-winning Havok physics engine.\n\nAs there are both two-player and single-player tables offered in each themed 'table pack', and since you can play on either side of the two-player 'Battle' tables, there are effectively three different play experiences per theme.\n\nThe Pinballistik business model is 'a la carte', with the first offering being Wild West themed 'Circle The Wagons' offered at a fairly low price. Two DLC themes are available at launch, bling-themed 'Made Of Money' and 30's sci-fi themed 'Sector X'. Since each theme contains both Battle and Classic tables, there are actually six tables available as of the launch-date.\n\nTable Themes\n\nCircle The Wagons - Many Wild West motifs, including animated can-can dancers, buffalo stampedes and griefing sand-storms. The center-piece of the table is a large six-shooter, you must lock six balls into this to get a chance to blast them back into play for a frenetic multi-ball mode.Made Of Money - Reminiscent of an up-scale casino theme, there are features such as 'Celebration' and 'Paparazzi' to be earned on either side of the Battle table. A unique feature here is a side-switch mechanic, whereby you get to play on 'both sides of the track'.Sector X - Science fiction theme inspired by 30s classic shows such as 'Buck Rogers' and 'Flash Gordon'. In Battle mode, a large force-field divides the players and must be knocked out temporarily to get balls across to your opponents side\n\nMultiplayer 'Battle' Tables\n\nPinballistik offers the first simultaneous 2-player pinball action on a home console via it's double-wide 'Battle' tables. Players may battle against their buddy, or else against an AI player at three different skill levels. Battles involve either a race to hit certain score thresholds, or to get the highest score in a set time. Penalties are applied, and points may even be stolen from opponents, if you get your own ball past their flippers. Goals and penalties are fully configurable, and players may operate on either the left or right side of the Battle tables. Since the tables are not symmetrical, the experience can be quite different depending which side of the table that you start on.\n\nTraditional 'Classic' Tables\n\nTraditional single-player 'Classic' pinball tables are also included, with authentic and familiar pinball features including:\n\nBall Save - Ability to temporarily save a ball that drains by hitting certain designated targetsSkill Shot - hit designated targets as you plunge the ball in to get a big points bonusMultipliers - modifiers that apply to the end-of-ball bonuses\n\nPower-Ups\n\nVarious power-ups may appear at various locations on the tables, and can imbue the players or balls with special abilities. Power-ups may be disabled for 'Classic' single-player tables for a more pure pinball experience.\n\nSome example power-ups:\n\n'Power-ball' looks electrified and scores double-points for everything it hits (and steal points from opponents in Battle mode).'Power-flippers' will make the flippers electrified for a short time - all balls hitting power flippers will turn into power-balls.'Thief' is a slotted power-up that allows players to steal all of their opponents balls currently in play.'Hot Potato' turns the ball into a deadly weapon against opponents in Battle mode: getting this past them will steal double the standard penalty percentage.",

PES 2014 will center everything on the ball: how it moves, and how players use it. Physics of the ball, stature of the player, speed and height of the pass, everything will be taken into account to recreate the most realistic football experience on a home system. Players will be an important part of the game with Motion Animation Stability System (M.A.S.S.), that will increase the realism of physical contacts between players, tackles and decisions taken on the pitch by the AI to have more open games. The audience will have an influence on the performance of the team. On the pitch, the performance of an individual player, good or bad, will also have an effect on the team, giving them a moral boost if he has a moment of individual brilliance; or forcing his teammates to support him if he is not doing well. \n\nIntroduced in PES 2013, the Player ID system recreated faithfully the movements and skills of about 50 star players. In PES 2014, that number is increased and will also apply to complete squads to replicate a team's playing style. With the new Combination Plan, users will be able set up a variety of different tactics in key areas of the pitch using three or more players. These players will make very different runs to exploit holes in the defense or midfield, using the flanks, curved runs, or overlapping play to make themselves available.\n\nNew for this year, players can now change teams in the Master League and coach a national side. Players are also able to create 3rd and 4th kits. Some third and fourth kits are official. The PS2 version has the same characteristics of the other versions. UEFA Europa League also appears as a single-mode.",

                "description": "Prototype 2 is an open-world action game published by Activision and developed by Radical Entertainment. It's a direct sequel to Prototype and was announced at the 2010 Spike Video Game Awards.\n\nThe events of Prototype 2 takes place in New York City, now known as New York Zero (NYZ), following Sgt. James Heller on his quest to destroy Alex Mercer, after having lost everything and everyone he loved to the Blacklight virus.\n\nStoryline:\nTwo years after the events of the original game, Sergeant James Heller, after returning from touring in Iraq, discovers his wife and daughter to be declared dead, causing him to rejoin the military in the fight for NYZ against the Blacklight virus. Heller is briefed on the previous outbreaks in Idaho in the '60s and in NYZ in the events of the first game. He later finds Mercer and begins chasing him.\n\nPursuing Mercer for vengeance, Heller is infected by Mercer with a strain that imbues him with similar superhuman abilities. After blacking out, Heller awakens in a Yellow Zone lab where Gentek scientist Dr. Anton Koenig and Blackwatch Col. Douglas Rooks are experimenting on him. Heller escapes from the Gentek base, when Mercer confronts him and claims Gentek and Blackwatch are responsible for recreating and cultivating the Blacklight virus, making them responsible for the second infection and the deaths of Heller's family. Revealing his plans to take down Gentek and Blackwatch, Mercer offers a truce to Heller. Unsure of Mercer's intentions Heller goes to his local pastor, Father Luis Guerra, for advice and help.\n\nUsing information supplied by Guerra, Heller hacks into Blacknet Terminals to find out about and sabotage a number of their operations. Gradually consuming his way through Blackwatch, Heller eventually finds and confronts Koenig, who claims to be on his side and reveals Blackwatch's super-soldier program, codenamed \"Orion\". Heller prevents Project: Orion's progress by killing a super-soldier who was injected with his DNA. After consuming one of the head scientists, Heller discovers that Koenig was observing him in order to find his weaknesses. Enraged at Koenig's betrayal, Heller tracks him down only to discover that he has powers similar to he and Mercer, and is one of several \"Evolved\" agents planted in Gentek and Blackwatch by Mercer. After defeating and consuming the doctor, Mercer reveals to Heller that he intends to recruit him in an attempt to control NYZ. His doubts growing, Guerra then shows Heller a video tape of Mercer releasing the virus for the second time in Penn Station, the same place Mercer originally released and contracted the virus.\n\nEnraged at Mercer's deception, Heller sets off to the Green Zone to hunt down Mercer's henchmen, including an Evolved agent in Gentek named Sabrina Galloway; upon confronting Galloway, however, Heller reluctantly teams up with her when she reveals she can help him take down Mercer. With Galloway's help, Heller soon finds that Mercer plans to infect the entire world through \"Whitelight\", a contaminated vaccine released by Gentek that actually serves to accelerate infection and evolution rather than prevent it.\n\nFrustrated with Heller sabotaging his plans, Mercer kills Father Guerra; upon finding his corpse, however, a grieving Heller uses Guerra's phone to reach Athena, Guerra's contact who is revealed to be Dana Mercer. Dana explains that Heller's daughter, Maya, is still alive, prompting Heller to head for the Red Zone to take down Mercer and save Maya. After preventing Blackwatch's second attempt to level Manhattan Island, Rooks helps Heller reach his daughter, only for Galloway to betray him and take Maya to Mercer. Upon confronting Mercer, he reveals that he plans to solve international conflicts and world problems by infecting the entire human race, effectively creating a Superorganism with Maya at the center. After Mercer absorbs Galloway and the remaining Evolved, the two engage in a bloody duel, only for James to emerge victorious and to kill and consume Mercer.\n\nSubsequently, Heller wipes out the infected in NYZ along with most of the Blacklight Virus; then using Mercer's absorbed memories, Heller locates and frees Maya and Dana from a vault. The story then ends with the three overlooking New York before Dana questions what to do next.",

The authorities, fearful of her knowledge and capabilities have arrested Nilin and wiped her memory clean. After her escape from prison, Nilin sets out on a mission to recover her identity, helped by her last and only friend. This search for her past leads to her being hunted by the very people that created this surveillance society.\n\nStoryline:\nNeo-Paris, 2084: Personal memories can now be digitized, bought, sold and traded. The last remnants of privacy and intimacy have been swept away in what appears to be a logical progression of the explosive growth of social networks at the beginning of the 21st century. The citizens themselves have accepted this surveillance society in exchange for the comfort only smart technology can provide.

                "description": "Tales speak of an ancient land where creatures the size of mountains, roam the majestic landscape. Bound to the land, these creatures hold a key to a mystical power of revival - a power you must obtain to waken a loved one.&#13;&#13;\nShadow of the Colossus is a majestic journey through ancient lands to seek out and destroy gigantic mythical beasts. With your trusty horse at your side, explore the spacious lands and unearth each Colossi. Armed with your wits, a sword and a bow, use cunning and strategy to topple each behemoth.&#13;&#13;\nFrom the original developers of the critically acclaimed ICO™, comes a masterpiece of an adventure.\n\nStoryline:\nThe story of Shadow of the Colossus begins as Wander enters the forbidden land, traveling across the long bridge at its entrance on his horse, Agro. According to Lord Emon later in the game, prior to entering the forbidden land Wander had stolen an ancient sword, which is the only weapon capable of slaying the colossi of the forbidden land. Led to the massive Shrine of Worship at the center of the region, Wander carries with him the body of a maiden named Mono. A moment later, several shadow-like creatures with humanoid forms appear and prepare to attack Wander, but he easily dismisses them with a wave of the ancient sword in his possession, which emits strong beams of light. After vanquishing the shadow creatures, the voice of the disembodied entity known as \"Dormin\" echoes from above, expressing surprise that Wander possesses the weapon. Wander requests that Dormin return Mono's soul to her body, which it states may be possible, but only if the sixteen idols lining the temple's hall are destroyed. It explains that this task can only be accomplished by using the ancient sword to kill sixteen colossi located throughout the land. Each contains a portion of Dormin's own essence, though this is not revealed until late in the game.\n\nDespite a warning from Dormin that he may have to pay a great price to revive Mono, Wander sets out to search the land for the colossi and destroy them. In a sequence after the eighth's slaying, a deterioration of Wander's body is shown clearly—his skin becoming paler, his hair darker, and dark streaks growing across his face. After the death of the twelfth colossus, it is revealed to the player that Wander is being pursued by a group of warriors led by Emon.\n\nUrged to hurry with his task by Dormin, Wander soon heads off to defeat the sixteenth and final colossus. On the way to this confrontation, he travels on horseback across a long bridge, which begins to collapse as he is halfway across. As Agro jumps over the last gap in the bridge, the portion which is landed on begins to separate from its foundation, causing Agro to nearly lose footing. Sensing the impending fall, Agro jerks forward to throw Wander to safety on the other side, making a sacrifice for him and falling into the river hundreds of feet below as the bridge finally gives way. Wander goes on to defeat the final colossus, and Emon's company arrives in the Shrine of Worship just as the last temple idol crumbles; Wander appears soon afterwards, his eyes and skin now both entirely pale, and two small horns protruding from his head. Declaring that Wander has been \"possessed by the dead\", Lord Emon orders his warriors to kill him. While he struggles to reach Mono, one warrior shoots Wander in the leg with a crossbow, while another stabs him through his heart with a sword. Black blood sprays from the wound as Wander's body becomes covered in darkness and falls to the floor—a death identical to those suffered by the colossi.\n\nAfterward, Dormin's spirit possesses Wander's body, transforming it into a shadowy giant. Dormin, now speaking in its masculine voice, explains that it had been separated to sixteen pieces—the colossi—to seal away its power, and that by entering Wander, who absorbed physical form from defeating each colossus, it is now whole again. While his men flee, Lord Emon casts the ancient sword into a small pool at the back of the temple's hall, creating a whirlwind of light that consumes Dormin and Wander. Emon and his men flee the forbidden land as the bridge connecting to the temple collapses behind them. As they safely arrive at the entrance to the forbidden land, Emon expresses hope that if Wander survived, someday he may be able to atone for his crimes.\n\nIn the temple, Mono awakens, restored by Dormin in accordance with its agreement with Wander, and Agro limps into the temple with an injured hind leg. Mono follows Agro to the pool into which Wander and Dormin were pulled by Emon's spell, finding a male infant with tiny horns on his head. She takes the child with her, following the horse to higher levels of the Shrine of Worship, and arrives at a secret garden within the shrine as the game ends.",

                "description": "Overview\n\nSkullgirls is a 2D fighting game developed by Reverge Labs and co-published by Autumn and Konami on Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network on April 10, 2012. It was later ported to the PC by Lab Zero and released via Steam by Marvelous AQL on August 22, 2013. Linux and Mac versions are being ported by outside sources with assistance from Lab Zero. The Japanese release of the PlayStation 3 version was published by CyberFront on February 14, 2013, with a Japanese arcade release on the NESiCAxLive board system.\n\nFollowing Lab Zero's cut-off with Konami, the game was set to be removed from PlayStation Network and Xbox Live. It was re-released in 2014 on these platforms, rebranded \"Skullgirls Encore\".\n\nStory\n\nSet in a 1940's dark Art Deco world (the Canopy Kingdom), the story revolves around a mysterious artifact called the Skull Heart, which grants a single wish to a young woman every seven years. However, women who attempt to use it with an impure heart become corrupted into a monstrous being of immense power (known as the \"Skullgirl\") and unleash chaos upon the world. Female fighters from all over the Kingdom seek to claim the artifact for themselves (for various different purposes), having to stop the current wielder, the Skullgirl Bloody Marie, in the process.\n\nHistory\n\nSkullgirls began its life as two separate “doujin” projects. Tournament fighter Mike “Mike Z” Zaimont had begun working on a fighting game engine, while Alex “o_8” Ahad had begun working on a world, story and characters for a fighting game. Some years later, mutual friends introduced them to one another, and their two personal projects were merged into the game we see today. Richard Wyckoff and Emil Dotchevski began Reverge Labs in 2010 after Pandemic Studios was shut down. Mike Z teamed up with Wyckoff, also a former Pandemic employee, and Reverge Labs to bring Skullgirls to home consoles.\n\nIn May of 2012 Autumn Games, the publisher for Skullgirls, became embroiled in a lawsuit alongside Konami filed against them by City National Bank over allegations of fraud. With their assets frozen by the courts, Autumn Games was unable to give Reverge Labs their share of the profits from sales of their game. Suddenly without income, the developer went through a series of layoffs before eventually dissolving, with the core team reforming under the newly branded Lab Zero Games in November of 2012.\n\nWhile the future of Skullgirls was uncertain, Mike Z and co. were bolstered by the continued support of their fans who helped them raise $78,000 in donations for breast cancer research in their bid for a spot at the EVO 2013 fighting game tournament.\n\nOn February 25th, 2013, an Indiegogo campaign for $150,000 was launched to fund development of their first DLC character, Squigly. Funding surpassed the initial goal almost immediately. Through stretch goals, four additional DLC characters were funded, as was the donation of the Z Engine powering the game to fellow independent fighting game developer Mane 6. In total the campaign raised $829,829.\n\nGameplay\n\nSkullgirls is designed as a competitive fighting game, taking inspiration from other games in the genre while implementing several unique systems of its own.\n\nInfinite Detection\n\nCentral to Skullgirls’ design is a unique infinite detection system, designed to make the game somewhat “self-balancing.” If the game detects that a player is looping a combo, the hit-sparks will change color and the opponent can break out of it with a single button press. However, as long as the player is changing up their combo and improvising, the combo can continue.\n\n“Ratio System” Tag Battles\n\nAt the start of battle, each player can pick one super-powerful character, two stronger characters or three normal characters - team sizes don't need to match. Single characters do more damage and have more HP, but lose the strategic advantages of character assists and the ability to regenerate health while off-screen.\n\nCustom Assists\n\nWhile each character comes with a few preset assists, Skullgirls also offers support for custom assists, allowing you to choose an assist move by inputting its motion during character selection. Aside from super moves, any ground action can be chosen - this includes throws, normal attacks, dashes, and any special move.\n\nBuilding Super Meter\n\nPlayers can build their super meter by whiffing normal attacks (attacking without hitting the opponent), but only if they stay in place or are moving forward - moving backwards and attacking will not build meter. Additionally, only one level can be built this way - if the player already has a super stocked, normal attacks must make contact with an opponent to build any more meter.\n\nHigh/Low Unblockables\n\nHigh/low unblockables exist in many fighting games, and are an extremely strong tactic when discovered. In Skullgirls, however, after a character blocks a high or low hit, they are protected for a period of time from being hit by the other type. The protection is short enough to not affect regular gameplay, but long enough that a player can successfully defend against the first attack and still be protected from what might otherwise be an unblockable second attack.\n\nCharacters\n\nThe eight launch characters are: Filia, Cerebella, Peacock, Parasoul, Ms. Fortune, Painwheel, Valentine and Double. Following the release the following characters were added: Squigly, Big Band, Fukua, Eliza, Beowulf and Robo-Fortune as DLC funded by a record-breaking Indiegogo campaign.\n\nFilia\n\n￼\n\nFilia was an average schoolgirl, but one day awoke without any memories. In their place was a powerful parasite named Samson, grafted to her head in the form of unruly hair - with eyes and teeth, no less. Unable to remember how her partnership with Samson began, Filia must trust the ancient being and wield his strength if she ever hopes to piece together her past... and survive the inevitable confrontation with the Skullgirl.\n\nFilia is a \"rushdown\" character. As such, she has only three special moves and makes up with it with lots of maneuverability and easily-comboed normal attacks.\n\nCerebella\n\n￼\n\nCerebella is the biggest sensation in the Cirque des Cartes - a tumbling, soaring dynamo of star power! Throughout the kingdom, Cerebella is admired for her daring, and lusted after for her curvaceous form. Sadly, the kind of approval she craves is the one kind she isn't getting: what Cerebella really longs for is praise from her patron and de facto father, mobster Vitale Medici, who rescued her from the street for a life of fame.\n\nFaced with Cerebella's inherent goodness, the only way Vitale can keep her doing such dirty work is withhold affection. Cerebella is the only person capable of controlling the living weapon Vice-Versa, so the cold and calculating Vitale must keep her wrapped around his little finger.\n\nCerebella is a grappler with command throws for virtually any situation. Unlike typical grappler characters, she doesn't have difficulty getting in close, either, thanks to an armored charge and aerial glide.\n\nPeacock\n\n￼￼\n\nThe magnum opus of the Anti-Skullgirl Labs, Peacock is a mechanical monstrosity built from a broken little girl.\n\nWhen she was rescued by the Labs’ Dr. Avian, she was just the orphan Patricia, her mind and body broken by the slave traders that captured her in the aftermath of the Grand War. Taking pity on her, Dr. Avian rebuilt the child with an arsenal of reality-defying weaponry, which was promptly twisted by the memories of the cartoons Patricia used to escape the pain of her slave life. Perhaps irretrievably damaged, she behaves like a rotten, spoiled and extremely unstable child. Terrifying as she may be, Peacock may very well be the best chance the Labs have to destroy the Skullgirl.\n\nPeacock is a \"zoning\" character, and plays a mean game of keep-away with a variety of projectile attacks and escape moves. While she's best at a distance, she can still hold her own up close.\n\nParasoul\n\n￼￼\n\nThe princess of the Canopy Kingdom and leader of its elite military, Parasoul's own mother became a Skullgirl when she was a child. She is fiercely protective of her little sister, Umbrella, and is frequently torn between defense of her country and defense of her family. Wielding the living umbrella, Kreig, Parasoul fights with grace, poise and cunning.\n\nParasoul is primarily a \"poking\" character, and uses a variety of \"charge\" moves. In addition to her long attack range, she can place napalm \"tears\" created by her umbrella around the screen as traps, as well as call on her troops for a variety of support functions.\n\nMs. Fortune\n\n￼￼\n\nA pun-loving cat burglar, Ms. Fortune is a feline humanoid of the undead persuasion. With her friends in the Fishbone Gang, she was hired to steal the Life Gem from the head of the Medici Mafia, which she swallowed it for safe-keeping. When the Mafia caught her and the rest of her gang, they murdered them, chopped them to pieces and threw them to the bottom of the ocean. The power of the Life Gem suffused Ms. Fortunes body, and she alone survived the ordeal, but her body still bears the scars of her murder - as a result, she can detach her head and stretch her body along those scars.\n\nMs. Fortune is a hybrid \"rushdown\" and \"puppet\" character. She can detach her head and control it independently from her body, and many of her attacks function differently depending on whether or not her head is currently attached.\n\nPainwheel\n\n￼￼\n\nA normal schoolgirl named Carol, until she was kidnapped by Valentine and transformed into Painwheel. Host to two synthetic parasites called Buer Drive and Gae Bolga, Painwheel draws her power from pain and fury.\n\nAn \"aerial dominance\" character, Painwheel can fly using her Buer Drive blade and charge her attacks, as well as confronting foes with spikes that eject painfully from her body. She can also contort her body into inhuman shapes and unleash her rage with brutal moves.\n\nValentine\n\n￼￼\n\nThe only survivor of the Last Hope, a group of special Anti-Skullgirl Lab operatives, Valentine now dutifully serves the Skullgirl. She keeps to herself, so much of her true nature and personality are unknown.\n\nValentine is a \"rushdown\" character with the ability to inflict status effects on her opponent: damage over time, increased hit stun and button lag, although only one may be active at a time. Her level five super allows her to revive a fallen team mate to one third of their health - made possible thanks to the fact that in Skullgirls a team mate's corpse remains on the screen after they are eliminated.\n\nDouble\n\n￼￼\n\nAn amorphous creature capable of assuming the form of any person, most frequently a smiling nun.\n\nA 'mimic' character, each of her normals looks like that of another character but will have vastly different frame data and properties. Though she transforms into other characters during her specials, they are completely unique, such as a projectile using Parasoul's gun, a Cerebella rush based on R-Mika's Flying Peach or a Sub-Zero ground slide as Filia. Her level five special transforms her into a Moai head in an homage to Gradius.\n\nSquigly\n\n￼￼\n\nSquigly is the last “surviving” member of the Contiello family, a long lineage of opera singers and among the Medicis’ most valued clients. Fourteen years ago, Squigly’s mother Selene obtained the Skull Heart, resulting in Lorenzo Medici ordering an attack on the Contiello family. Fraught with despair, Selene became the Skullgirl and revived her family as an undead army. What spared Squigly from becoming a mindless minion was the intervention of the Parasite Leviathan, the Contiello family’s friend and guardian\n\nBig Band\n\n￼￼\n\nBen Birdland has seen a lot in his time, including the worst of the Grand War. But nothing was worse than what he saw as a beat cop in New Meridian. When he ran afoul of his crooked unit he was given a violent early retirement, and his broken body was left to spend the rest of its days in an iron lung.\n\nThat would have been the end of Ben’s story if it hadn’t drawn the ears of the Anti-Skullgirl Labs. With little left to lose, he agreed to be rebuilt with their experimental procedures. Melded with the machinery that allows him to breathe and a powerful an array of pneumatic weaponry, he was reborn as “Big Band.”\n\nEliza\n\n￼￼\n\nA famous nightclub singer in New Meridian, Eliza got caught up in a scheme by the Medici family when they discovered that her many charitable \"blood drives\" were actually what's keeping her young and beautiful. Faced with blackmail, Eliza reacts just about exactly how one might expect a vain and vengeful woman to.\n\nShe wields the Staff of Ra and uses her own blood to fight, along with a second form that's simply the skeleton parasite beneath her skin, Sehkmet. In battle, she's assisted by her bodyguards Horus and Albus.\n\nBeowulf\n\n￼￼\n\nKnown world-wide for felling the Gigan warrior Grendel and for his illustrious career in the ring, Beowulf had secured himself a spot in the history books as a champion. But a mediocre acting career after leaving the ring tarnished his legacy.\n\nBeowulf usually just relies on his holds, throws, open-handed strikes. He also wields his trusty folding chair, \"The Hurting,\" and Grendel's arm.\n\nRobo-Fortune\n\n￼￼\n\nRobo Fortune is the creation of Brain Drain, the psychic director of ASG Lab Zero, and stands as a testament to her maniacal creator’s unmatched pride and petulance. Built to demonstrate loyalty and cunning, Robo Fortune fails to deliver either to any measurable degree. Employing cutting-edge technology, she sets out to hunt down the Skullgirl, and to engage in easily avoidable conflicts.\n\nOther Features\n\nGraphics\n\nSkullgirls features a powerful 3D engine to power its predominantly 2D presentation.\n\nCharacters are assembled from three layers (line, shading and color) and colored via a custom shader. They are illuminated by dynamic rim lights and per-pixel lighting generated by light sources in the environment and hit sparks.\n\nThe backgrounds are 3D, although use minimal geometry and high-resolution textures to retain a painterly look.\n\nAnimation\n\nAveraging around 1400 frames of animation per character, Skullgirls features the most frames of animation per character of any 2D fighting game. Additionally, the sprites are of very high resolution - they're twice the size they are on the screen for filtering and zoom-in purposes.\n\nGGPO Netcode\n\nSkullgirls' online experience is built upon the Good Game, Peace Out (GGPO) networking library, a favorite of the hardcore fighting game community.\n\nEasier Inputs\n\nIn order to shift the game’s focus from executing difficult moves to fighting strategically, the game features simplified inputs.\n\nFor example, if a character has any 360 moves, the game will be able to tell if the player completes a 360 even if the player didn’t execute it at speeds that would be required in another fighting game. Not only does this make execution of these moves and make grappler characters easier, it also prevents the character from hopping (which occurs whenever the 'up' direction is pressed) at the apex of the 360 movement.\n\nSoundtrack\n\nReverge Labs announced that Skullgirls' soundtrack will be composed by Michiru Yamane, a composer on numerous Castlevania games.\n\nPC System Requirements\n\nOS: Windows XP, Window Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8Processor: Dual-core CPUMemory: 2 GB RAMGraphics: Intel HD3000DirectX: Version 9.0cNetwork: Broadband Internet connectionHard Drive: 2 GB available space",

It uses the same weapon-based fighting system from previous games; however, several of the gameplay mechanics are changed, simplified or otherwise removed. Similar to other free-to-play titles like Tekken Revolution, microtransactions are offered, some of which remove the playtime limit of the game. The game is also periodically updated with new content, including new events, items, and characters.\n\nThe game ceased operations effective on November 30, 2015, as per an announcement on September 1, 2015",

The objective of the game is to investigate the mines underneath the old Western town Tumbleton in order to unearth the secrets lurking below. The player controls Rusty who is equipped with a pickaxe but the player is given options to upgrade the tools used for digging as progression is made in the game. Besides health, the player also needs coal for light, and water for special abilities.\nSteamWorld Dig has platform elements in that the player runs, jumps and encounter foes, but the main objective is mining. That means that the player builds – or rather deconstructs – the game world and creates platforms that way. The player collects resources and other hidden resources which can be brought back to the surface and exchanged for cash. When the player progress in the game new abilities are unlocked. Each playthrough, the mines are randomized, making items and treasure appear in different locations. If the player gets stuck there is a self destruct function, but the players can also buy ladders in the store at the surface to get out of tricky situations.\nWhen progressing deeper down in the cave, the player encounters various enemies with different attack patterns and weak spots. The game features multiple worlds, each with a completely different environment. Dying results in a reparation penalty fee, and the player respawns back on the surface. All the loot that has been accumulated when the player dies can be picked up again.",

For the first time in the series, players are able to play as characters other than Kirito. In addition, players are able to create their own custom characters, though the story mode will still progress as if you were playing as Kirito. Parties of up to three characters may be formed, up from two in the prior games. In keeping with being set in Alfheim Online, players are able to fly as well as walk on the ground. However, walking within dungeons is mandatory. Auto-attacks are disabled while in flight mode, but players may instead target individual parts of an enemy's body as they see fit. In addition, this game adds the ability to use magic to attack enemies or to provide support to one's party. The game is the first in the series to allow for four-person online multiplayer.",

As a member of an elite order of knights, join a centuries-old war that will determine the course of history forever.\n\nStoryline:\nThe Order: 1886 is set in an alternate history London, where an old order of knights keep all of the world safe from half bred monsters, who are a combination of animal and man. In the game's history, around the seventh or eighth centuries a small number of humans took on bestial traits. The majority of humans feared these half breeds and war broke out. Despite the humans outnumbering the half breeds, their animal strength gave them the upper hand in centuries of conflict.\nCenturies later, humanity finds new hope in King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table. King Arthur and his like-minded knights take the fight to the half breeds, but Arthur soon realizes it's a losing battle. Through a mysterious turn of fate The Knights discover Black Water, a mystical liquid that significantly extends their lifetimes and gives them remarkable healing abilities. Despite this new advantage the half breeds continue to win battle after battle, until the industrial Revolution turns the tide. Inventors are far ahead of their time, inventing technologies such as thermal imaging, Zeppelins, and wireless communications. New weapons belch electricity, ignite clouds of molten metal on top of enemies, and fulfil dual functions as Fragmentation grenades and proximity mines.\nBy 1886, the war still goes on, but the humans almost have martial law. A new threat emerges in the form of the lower classes rebelling against the rich and the social order, with the Knights supporting the well-to-do upper classes and nobles. The game features four main protagonists from the same squad, who each has a given name, and the adopted name of one of the original Knights. The oldest is Sebastian Mallory, the second to bear the name of Sir Percival, and the descendant of Thomas Mallory, who in the 1400s wrote Le Morte d'Arthur, the definitive Arthurian Text. A close friend of Grayson, he is one of the best Knights in the history of the order.\nGrayson is the third to bear the title of Sir Galahad, and has battled the order's enemies for centuries. He views Mallory as a mentor, Lafayette as a friend, and Isabeau as a potential love interest. Other than that, little is known about him so far. Isabeau D'Argyll is one of the younger Knights in the order, but is much older than her appearance of being in her late twenties. The latest Lady Igraine, Isabeau was Grayson's apprentice and if not for her commitment to the order, his lover. Marquis de Lafayette was a French military officer who fought in the French and American Revolutions. His tactical expertise brought him to the order's attention, and Mallory approached him and convinced him to join the order. Although the group's youngest, his globetrotting has given him a whimsical outlook on life that grounds the squad. As an apprentice, he does not yet bear the name of a Knight.",

                "description": "Overview\n\n￼Clementine, the game's protagonist, is often put into dangerous situations.\n\nThe Walking Dead: Season Two is a five-part horror adventure game developed and published by Telltale for the Xbox 360 (via Xbox Live Arcade), PlayStation 3 (via PlayStation Network), PC, Mac, PlayStation Vita (via PlayStation Network) and most iOS and Android devices. Episodes were periodically released as downloadables by Telltale between December 17, 2013 and August 26, 2014.\n\nThe sequel to the original The Walking Dead game (based on Robert Kirkman's comic book series of the same name), players continue the story of Clementine, an orphaned 9-year-old girl (and the former companion of Lee Everett, the main protagonist of the original game) trying to survive throughout Georgia, U.S.A. over a year after the initial outbreak of the undead apocalypse.\n\nLike the game's predecessor, The Walking Dead: Season Two focuses less on killing large numbers of the undead and more about human interaction that tailor the player's story to the pressured choices they are forced to make. Choices made in the original game (including its downloadable chapter) can be imported (as long as the save file exists on the same machine), influencing minor parts of the story. A third installment is currently in development.\n\nThe game was re-released in retail form, with all episodes included, for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, PC, and Mac on October 14, 2014. It was then released (in both retail and downloadable forms, with all episodes included) for the Xbox One and PlayStation 4 on October 21, 2014, and then for the PlayStation Vita on November 4, 2014.\n\nEpisodes\n\nEpisode 1: All That Remains (December 17, 2013)\n\nSet eight months after the conclusion of the first season Clementine, Omid and Christa are travelling together when they come across a gas station and public restrooms. Deciding to stop and clean themselves the couple and Clementine enter into separate bathrooms but whilst cleaning herself Clementine drops her bottle of water which rolls into one of the stalls in the bathroom. Whilst retrieving the water however a scavenger enters into the bathroom and equips herself with Clementine's gun and begins to search through her backpack for anything of use. Clementine accidentally making a sound is coaxed out by the scavenger who begins to question and intimidate Clementine. Omid stealthily entering after hearing the scavengers voice attempts to approach the scavenger but the sound of the closing door causes the scavenger turn and reflex fire at whatever made the sound and so shoots and kills Omid. Christa hearing the gunshot bursts into the room and kills the scavenger who immediately dropped her weapon and began pleading and apologising upon realising what she had just done.\n\nThe game then jumps a further 16 months ahead to Clementine and Christa sitting around a fire in the woods as the pair now attempt to make their way to Wellington where Christa believes it may be safer. The campfire is dying however and as the pair attempt to additional firewood the pair separated from one another after they are ambushed by bandits in the woods which Clementine manages to escape from by falling into a nearby river.\n\nThe next day Clementine awakens on a riverbank outside of a wood and shortly after entering it she encounters a dog and abandoned campsite. After searching the area Clementine manages to find a can of baked beans which she pries open with a pocket knife and begins to eat. The dog visibly hungry begins to beg and eventually attacks Clementine over the food, biting her arm quite badly and resulting in Clementine managing to fight off the attacking dog who is impaled lying tent posts through his torso and hind legs.\n\nSetting off into the woods Clementine almost passes out with the pain but is rescued from attacking zombies by a pair of survivors, Luke and Pete, who bring Clementine back to their camp but the group are questionable about the bite wound on her arm. Not wanting to risk wasting supplies on an infected wound the group opts to lock Clementine in a shed overnight and if she hasn't turned by the next morning will assist her and provide her with aid. Clementine deciding to escape from the shed and steal supplies enters into the groups house to do so after which she returns to the shed and cleans and sutures her wound shut. Suddenly she is attacked by a zombie who enters through the hole she created to escape the shed and manages to fight off the attacker and in doing so is allowed into the cabin by the group.\n\nThe next day while on a fishing trip with Luke and Pete, the trio encounter a scattering of new bodies on the riverbank including various members of the bandit group who attacked Christa and Clementine at the start of the episode. As the trio investigate the situation a group of zombies attack the three are separated with Clementine opting to either escape with Luke or Pete into the woods.\n\nEpisode 2: A House Divided (March 4, 2014)\n\nThe episode starts with the player in the company of either Luke or Pete (depending on their choice in the previous episode) trapped by zombies. Eventually after a distraction Clementine escapes and returns to the cabin used by the group for shelter where she encounters Carlos and Rebecca awaiting their return and after Clementine explains the events which unfolded leave Clementine alone with Carlos' daughter Sarah.\n\nWhilst the two girls are talking a stranger (Carver) knocks on the door and enters the cabin and begins to question Clementine. Eventually he discovers a picture of Sarah who he was in search for and when the other members of the group return Clementine informs them of the stranger who determine the best course of action is to flee into the woods.\n\nAfter five days of travelling the group spots a ski lodge in the distance and Clementine and Luke head off to investigate and clear a path across a bridge which must be crossed to reach the lodge. After clearing the bridge a man with a rifle approaches Clementine and Luke and begins to question the duo. Eventually he begins to lower his weapon and offer the two some shelter and food but just after he does so Nick approaches and shoots the man despite Clementine and Luke's efforts to calm him down and stop him.\n\nThe group continues onwards and soon arrives at the ski lodge and as the group investigate the area Clementine scouts the area behind them to see if they are still being chased by Carver. In the distance Clementine spots some lights flashing by the bridge and forest they passed through but before informing the group hears a dispute occurring between her group and another group who are inhabiting the lodge. Pushing her way through she finds Kenny and all disputes stop between the two groups and the two reunite.\n\nAfter a meal with the new group the owner of the lodge Walter asks to have a private conversation with Clementine outside of the lodge and shortly after the two are joined by Kenny. Just as Kenny appears though the trio catch a woman peering into the lodge who then asks for some food for her children - though it is later revealed that the woman was a member of Carvers group who are in pursuit of Clementine and her group and was merely scouting the area in search of the group.\n\nUpon returning to the lodge after giving the woman some food, Clementine is informed by Luke that the man on the bridge who had died was in fact Kenny's partner but before Clementine can retrieve the knife she found which belonged to Walter's partner Matthew, Walter finds the knife and manages to deduce the fate of his partner.\n\nAs Clementine speaks with Walter and attempts to explain what happened a storm begins to brew and the sound of a wind turbine which provides power to the lodge begins to draw more walkers towards the lodge. As they turn off the turbine the transformer overloads and Kenny and Luke set off to check out what exactly happened. After struggling through a walker attack another group (Carver) appears out of the woods and finishes off the remaining walkers with assault rifles and takes the majority of the group hostage.\n\nKenny having not being captured begins to fire at Carver and the bandit group but eventually surrenders after his new girlfriend is threatened by Carver and he too is taken captive. Luke still not present is assumed by Carver to have deserted his current group and the remaining members are taken by Carver back to his home.\n\nEpisode 3: In Harm's Way (May 13, 2014)\n\nThe group having been taken prisoner by Carver while the aftermath of the ski lodge invasion begins to leave its mark on Clementine.\n\nEpisode 4: Amid the Ruins (July 22, 2014)\n\nIn the aftermath of recent events, the group tries to find a way to navigate through the herd while Clementine and Jane go out to search for the grief stricken Sarah.\n\nEpisode 5: No Going Back (August 26, 2014)\n\nClementine is forced to deal with the consequences of her past actions after she's ambushed by Arvo and his group.\n\nSystem Requirements\n\nPC\n\nMinimum\n\nOS: Windows XP Service Pack 3Processor: Core 2 Duo 2GHz or equivalentMemory: 3 GB RAMGraphics: ATI or NVidia card w/ 512 MB RAMDirectX: Version 9.0cHard Drive: 2 GB available spaceSound Card: Direct X 9.0c sound deviceAdditional Notes: Not recommended for Intel integrated graphics\n\nRecommended\n\nOS: Windows XP Service Pack 3Processor: Core 2 Duo 2.3 Ghz or equivalentMemory: 4 GB RAMGraphics: ATI or NVidia card w/ 1024 MB RAMDirectX: Version 9.0cHard Drive: 2 GB available spaceSound Card: Direct X 9.0c sound deviceAdditional Notes: Not recommended for Intel integrated graphics\n\nMac\n\nMinimum\n\nOS: Snow Leopard (10.6.X)Processor: 2.3 Ghz IntelMemory: 4 GB RAMGraphics: 512 MB NVidia or ATI graphics cardHard Drive: 2 GB available spaceAdditional Notes: Not recommended for Intel integrated graphics or Mac Minis or early-generation MacBook\n\nRecommended\n\nOS: Snow Leopard (10.6.X)Processor: Core 2 Duo 2GHzMemory: 4 GB RAMGraphics: 1024 MB NVidia or ATI graphics cardHard Drive: 2 GB available spaceAdditional Notes: Not recommended for Intel integrated graphics or Mac Minis or early-generation MacBooks",

                "description": "Tomb Raider explores the intense and gritty origin story of Lara Croft and her ascent from a young woman to a hardened survivor. Armed only with raw instincts and the ability to push beyond the limits of human endurance, Lara must fight to unravel the dark history of a forgotten island to escape its relentless hold.\n\nStoryline:\nhe game begins with Lara setting out on her first expedition aboard the ship Endurance, with the intention of finding the lost kingdom of Yamatai. By her suggestion and against Whitman's advice, the expedition ventures into the Dragon's Triangle, east of Japan. The ship is struck by a violent storm and shipwrecked, leaving the survivors stranded on an isolated island. Lara is separated from the others and captured by a strange, savage man. She manages to escape while her captor is killed as the cave collapses due to her actions. As Lara tries to locate the other survivors, she finds more evidence that the island is inhabited, such as strange carvings, dead bodies, and animal sacrifices. She eventually finds her friend Sam and a man called Mathias, who claims to be a teacher who was shipwrecked on the island. As Sam tells Mathias the legends of Himiko, Lara passes out; when she wakes, Mathias and Sam are nowhere in sight. When Lara regroups with the other survivors, Whitman decides to go with Lara and search for the still-missing Roth, while the rest of the group (Reyes, Jonah, Alex and Grim) set out to find Sam and Mathias. As Lara and Whitman explore, they discover that the island's inhabitants are worshipping Himiko, confirming that the island is Yamatai. Upon discovering a shrine erected in Himiko's name, they are captured by the islanders and taken to a settlement along with several other survivors from the Endurance. When the survivors attempt an escape, the captors turn on them. Lara is separated from Whitman and tries to hide, but is found by one of the islanders and forced to kill him. She fights off the remainder of the attackers and reunites with Roth, saving him from a wolf attack.\n\nLara manages to activate a radio tower and call for help, but the plane that answers the call is struck by a freak storm, and Lara hears a mysterious voice saying \"No one leaves\" in Japanese. Unable to save the surviving pilots, Lara is contacted by Alex and Reyes, who reveal that Sam has been kidnapped by the islanders, a violent cult known as the Solarii Brotherhood. Lara tries to rescue her, but is stopped by Mathias, leader of the Solarii, and ordered killed: she is saved by an attack from samurai-like Oni. Escaping the ancient monastery where she is taken by the Oni, she hears from Sam that Mathias is going to put her through the \"Ascension\", a \"fire ritual\" to find the next Sun Queen that will burn her to death if it is unsuccessful. Lara follows them to the Solarii fortress and is aided by Grim. The Solarii take Grim hostage, but he sacrifices himself so Lara can escape. With Roth's aid, Lara infiltrates the fortress and sees the ritual begin. When the fires are lit, a great wind blows them out, showing Sam to be the next Sun Queen. Lara escapes again and reunites with her friends, forming a plan to rescue Sam and escape. Aided by Whitman—who has managed to negotiate some degree of freedom with the Solarii—Lara returns to the palace to rescue Sam as Roth commandeers a helicopter to get them out. Lara succeeds, but persuades Sam to escape by land when she sees another storm gathering as the helicopter approaches. As Lara tries to force the helicopter pilot to land, they are brought down, with Lara nearly dying. Roth revives Lara, then takes a fatal blow from Mathias meant for Lara. While mourning Roth, Lara accepts that the storms are not natural, but are somehow connected to the Sun Queen and designed to prevent anyone from leaving the island. She meets up with the other survivors, who have evaded the Solarii long enough to secure a boat for escaping the island, provided that it can be repaired. They are joined by Whitman, who claims to have escaped, though Lara begins to suspect him of working with the cultists. Lara and Alex find parts for the boat in the wreck of the Endurance. They come under attack by the Solarii and Alex triggers an explosion, sacrificing himself so that Lara can escape with the tools.\n\nFinding an account of a World War II-era Japanese military and Nazi scientific expedition to the island that sought a way to harness the storms as a weapon, Lara decides to explore a coastal tomb, where she finds the remains of a samurai general who committed seppuku. It is revealed in a message he left that he led the Queen's Stormguard, the Oni that defend the monastery, and that the Queen's successor took her own life rather than receive the Sun Queen's power. Lara realizes that the Ascension is not a ceremony to crown a new queen, but rather a ritual that transfers the original Sun Queen's soul into a new body; the Sun Queen had learned to become effectively immortal by transferring her soul into a young girl's body each time she grew old. The last priestess' suicide had interrupted the ritual, and left the Queen's soul trapped in her old decaying body, and Himiko's spirit has wanted to escape that corpse ever since. As a descendant of Yamatai, Sam is a viable candidate, and Mathias plans to offer Sam as a new host in exchange for his freedom. Lara returns to the survivors on the beach to find that Whitman has betrayed them, abducting Sam and handing her over to Mathias. Lara, Jonah and Reyes give chase, heading up a river to the monastery, with Lara arriving just in time to see Mathias trick Whitman into approaching and speaking to the Oni: the Oni kill Whitman. After fighting her way through both the Solarii and the Stormguard, Lara arrives at the top of the monastery where Mathias is performing the Ascension ritual. Lara fights her way to the central platform, and after a struggle, knocks Mathias off the platform to his death. Symbolically, she does so using both her pistol and his in a dual-wield style that will later become one of her signatures. Despite Mathias' death, the ritual is already underway, with Himiko's soul starting to pour into Sam, but Lara then destroys Himiko's ancient remains, saving Sam and dispersing the storms. Lara, Sam, Reyes and Jonah then leave the island and are picked up by a cargo ship: as they sail home, Lara realizes that the mythical stories her father told her were more than stories, deciding not to return home just yet, and the screen fades to white with a proclamation of \"A Survivor is Born.\"",

It was originally scheduled to be released on the PlayStation 3 and feature PlayStation Move support, but in August 2014, the game was reintroduced as a PlayStation 4 exclusive.\n\nUntil Dawn is designed to be played multiple times, as players will miss out on quite a bit of content with a single playthrough. Each will last about nine hours in length and the game mechanics utilize a new in-game system called the \"Butterfly Effect\" in which any choice of action by the player may cause unforeseen consequences later on. For example, locating a weapon in an earlier chapter may allow the player to pick it up down the line when a chase scene leads back to the same room. Throughout the game, players will make difficult decisions during ethical or moral dilemmas, such as sacrificing one character to save another. The Butterfly Effect system blurs the line between right and wrong decisions and it is possible for players to keep all eight characters alive as well as having all eight of them die, allowing for many different paths and scenarios as well as offering several different endings. Until Dawn has a strict auto-save system to prevent players from reloading a previous save file to an earlier point in the game if they regret an in-game decision they have made. The only way to change the player's choice is to restart the game from the beginning or continue to the end and start a new game. In a developer interview, it has been said that Until Dawn has \"hundreds of endings\". Different endings have different variations depending on the combination of characters alive at the end of the game.\n\nThe gameplay is focused on exploration, quick-time events and discovering clues as well as making decisions. There is an in-game system that will keep track of all of the clues and secrets players have discovered in total, even if there are multiple playthroughs; these clues will allow the player to piece together the mysteries of Blackwood. In terms of the gameplay mechanics and theme, Until Dawn has been noted to be similar to Heavy Rain and Beyond: Two Souls.\n\nUntil Dawn was met with a positive critical response upon release, with praise directed at the visuals, choice mechanic, horror elements, music, voice acting and gameplay design. Most of the criticism the game drew was concerning the story, mostly the second half, camera angles, character movements and partially linear plot.\n\nStoryline:\nWhen a trip to a remote cabin leaves eight friends stranded on a mountainside, sinister events make them suspect they're not alone...\n\nGripped by fear and with tensions in the group running high, step into the quaking boots of each of the eight terrified characters as you search for clues to the deranged killer's identity. By making life or death decisions using the sophisticated \"butterfly effect\" system, everything you do will drastically alter the course of the story - and the fate of each character.",

It is built upon a freemium business model where the game is free-to-play, but participants also have the option of paying a fee for use of \"premium\" features. The focus is on player vs. player gameplay with each player controlling an armored vehicle, which may be a light, medium or heavy tank, tank destroyer, or self-propelled gun. World of Tanks debuted as an eSports game at the World Cyber Games 2012.\n\nThe player takes control of a single armored vehicle of his or her choosing, and is placed into a battle on a random map. The player has control over the vehicle's movement, firing, and can communicate with other players through typed or voice chat, and several preset actions that give tactical instructions visible to only their team. The methods used to win a match are either destroying all vehicles on the opposing team or capturing a base present in some game modes. World of Tanks contains multiple game mechanics such as camouflage, shell ricochets, and module damage.",

The game features an open-world environment and action-based battle system similar to the Kingdom Hearts series and Type-0, incorporating the ability to switch weapons and other elements such as vehicle travel and camping.\n\nStoryline:\nThe game takes place in a world similar to modern-day Earth. The nations of the world once waged war over control of the world's crystals, and all but the nation of Lucis have lost theirs and regressed to medieval societies. Noctis Lucis Caelum, Crown Prince of the kingdom of Lucis—having gained magical power from a near-death experience—is driven from his home when the empire of Niflheim invades Lucis on the eve of the final peace negotiations between the two nations.

                "description": "We live in a complex world. The more advanced it gets, the more vulnerable it becomes. We’ve created a house of cards. Remove just one and everything falls apart. \n\nOn Black Friday, a devastating pandemic sweeps through New York City and, one by one, basic services fail. In only days, without food or water, society collapses into chaos. The Division, an autonomous unit of tactical agents, is activated. Leading seemingly ordinary lives among us, the agents are trained to operate independently in order to save society. When society falls, your mission begins.\n\nStoryline:\nOn Black Friday, a smallpox pandemic, transmitted by a virus planted on banknotes, sweeps through New York City. The disease, known as \"Green Poison\" or \"The Dollar Flu\", causes widespread chaos, and Manhattan is placed under quarantine. The U.S. Government activates sleeper agents in the population who operate for the Strategic Homeland Defense Agency , or simply \"The Division\", to assist emergency responders, now called the Joint Task Force (JTF), in restoring order. In Brooklyn, the protagonist, a Division agent, assists the JTF before planning to depart for the Quarantine zone with fellow agent Faye Lau. However, the VTOL meant to take them there is destroyed in an explosion, killing the Division Commander and wounding Faye Lau. Arriving in a JTF helicopter instead, the Division agents reclaim the James A. Farley Post Office Building as their base of operations. From there, the agents undertake assignments to rescue important personnel, help in restoring the base of operations to full working capacity and combat criminal groups, such as the Rioters, common street thugs in New York who generally want to take advantage of the quarantine, the Rikers, escapees from Rikers Island, and the Cleaners, insane New York Sanitation workers who wield flamethrowers and believe everyone is infected. In the course of the game, the agent helps rescue important personnel like Dr. Jessica Kandel, Captain Roy Benitez and Paul Rhodes. These personnel head the Medical, Security and Tech wings of the base of operations respectively. Agents also recover a sample of Green Poison. Studying the sample reveals the virus was manufactured and then modified heavily by a controversial biologist named Gordon Amherst.\n\nEventually, the agents find footage of Division agent Aaron Keener going rogue and killing other agents. It is also discovered Keener and other agents who went rogue along with him are assisting the \"Last Man Battalion\" (LMB), a traitorous private military company that was abandoned by the government during the evacuation, now hostile to it. Working together, these two groups destroyed the VTOL and killed the Commander to weaken Division operations in New York. Intercepting a signal from the Russian consulate, the agents attempt to rescue Vitaly Tchernenko, a Russian virologist who claims to have information on the Green Poison. However, he is kidnapped by Keener and the LMB before the Division can reach him. After helping the JTF secure supplies and weapons, the JTF and Division agents launch an attack on the LMB's base, the evacuated United Nations headquarters. The agent finds footage of Keener and his fellow rogue agents abandoning the LMB, with Tcherneko as their prisoner. The leader of the LMB, Charles Bliss, attempts to escape in a helicopter, but the agent destroys the vehicle, killing Bliss. Lau informs the agent that with most threats destroyed or weakened, New York is approaching stability, but an unknown signal leads the agent to a secluded laboratory. There, they find Dr. Amherst's remains, having discovered that he has died from exposure to his own virus. They also find a message from Keener, showing he has the technology to manufacture a new strain of Green Poison and intends to do so, and mysteriously tells the agent to explore the center of Manhattan, called the “Dark Zone.” The agent is informed that the information in the lab will further the development of a vaccine and is shown a recovered message from Amherst. In the message, Amherst reveals he engineered Green Poison as part of his eco-terrorist plan to decimate the human race and preserve the planet.",

Persona 5 is a role-playing game in which players live out a year in the life of a high school boy who gains the ability to summon facets of his psyche, known as Personas. Dungeon exploration features additional elements from previous iterations, such as jumping across gaps or dashing between cover. Dungeons feature a mixture of fixed environments tied into the plot and theme, and randomly generated environments. Battles are based on a turn-based attack system, with the characters wielding both their Personas and two weapon types: a gun and a melee weapon. The Social Link element from Persona 3 and 4 also returns in an altered form.\n\nStoryline:\nThe story focuses on the 16-year-old protagonist after he is transferred to Syujin High School in Tokyo, Japan. Staying with friends of his parents, he meets up with problem child Ryuji Sakamoto, the withdrawn Ann Takamaki, art student Yusuke Kitagawa, and a talking, shape-shifting cat-like creature known as Morgana.\n\nDuring the protagonist's time there, feeling suppressed by their environment, the five form a group known as the \"Phantom Thieves of Hearts\", working together to explore the \"Palace\", a castle created by the hearts of people, and steal ill intent from others' hearts to help them: during this quest, they confront adult authority figures opposing them, along with a greater enemy revealed by their activities.",

It’s the best way to experience the story of what really happened before the iconic mansion incident that was the catalyst for the entire Resident Evil saga.\n\nThe story of Resident Evil 0 takes players back to 1998. Reports have been mounting about unusual murders on the outskirts of Raccoon City. The city’s Special Forces division, S.T.A.R.S., sends their Bravo Team - including rookie cop member Rebecca Chambers - to investigate. On route, the team’s helicopter suffers engine trouble and is forced to make a crash landing, where they find an overturned prisoner transport vehicle. Splitting up to search the area, Rebecca discovers the Ecliptic Express, a train stopped dead on the tracks. Inside, she meets death row convict and ex-Navy lieutenant Billy Coen. Throughout the game, you will take control of both Rebecca and Billy, at times switching between both characters in order to proceed. Learning the advantages of each character is the key to solving puzzles and surviving the nightmares that lie ahead.",

Joel, a Texan in his forties with the \"emotional range of a teaspoon\" (to quote Hermione from Harry Potter), finds himself responsible with the safety of a fourteen year old girl named Ellie whom he must smuggle to a militia group called the Fireflies. And as if the infected aren't enough of a hassle, they also have to deal with the authorities who wouldn't let them leave the quarantine zone, as well as other survivors capable of killing anyone who might have something useful in their backpacks.\n\nStoryline:\nJoel, a ruthless survivor with few moral lines left to cross, lives in one of the last remaining Quarantine Zones. These walled-off, oppressive cities are run by what’s left of the military. Despite the strict martial law, Joel operates in the black market of the city, smuggling contraband for the right price. \n\nJoel is asked by a dying friend to look after Ellie, a fourteen-year-old girl with courage beyond her years. What starts out as a simple job to deliver Ellie to another Quarantine Zone, soon transforms into a profound journey that will forever change Joel and Ellie. \n\nAs they journey across a post-pandemic United States, Joel and Ellie will encounter different factions of survivors that have each found a unique way of dealing with the infected humans, the lack of supplies, and the threat of other survivors. As Joel and Ellie struggle to persevere, they must learn to trust each other and work together in order to survive the realities of this new world.",

At the same time, Garrett learns about a prophecy: the coming of a Dark Age. He embarks upon a journey to unravel a mystery that threatens the existence of the order of Keepers. Is it possible that there is a traitor in their midst?\n\nThe stealth and thievery game, Thief: Deadly Shadows comes with a number of improvements over two previous parts. Released in 2004, it left behind the aging Dark Engine, using a heavily modified Unreal engine instead. Realistic lighting effects have been implemented: each character and object now casts its own shadow. A third person's view has been made available in addition to the standard first person perspective.\n\nThe stealth system that made Thief: The Dark Project and Thief 2: The Metal Age famous is still in place. You have to stick to the shadows and avoid making noise, as guards will react to anything suspicious. It is also the first game of the series that introduced free roaming. The City, divided into several unlockable districts, is yours to explore. You can interact with the city's inhabitants: pickpocket, steal, or even mug them for loot.",

The New Order utilizes a health system in which the player's health is divided into separate sections that regenerate; if an entire section is lost, the player must use a health pack to replenish the missing health, in a similar fashion to games such as The Chronicles of Riddick: Escape from Butcher Bay and Resistance: Fall of Man. The player also has access to a non-limited weapon inventory, dual wielding certain weapons, as well as the ability to lean around, over and under cover, and perform a combat slide. Certain weapons also have special abilities such as a laser cannon which transforms into a cutting tool, and some turrets can be pulled from their stationary position and carried around. Semi-destructible environments have also been confirmed.\n\nStoryline:\nEurope, 1946. World War II rages across Europe. Where once the Allies pressed advantage, the Nazi forces have turned the tide in dramatic fashion behind the technologically advanced war machine of General Wilhelm Strasse -- Deathshead. When a final Allied assault on Deathshead's compound fails, the Allies’ greatest hope falls with it.\n\nEurope, 1960. The war is over. And the Nazis are triumphant victors. Using unrelenting force and brutal intimidation, the Nazis have brought even the most powerful nations to their knees. The Nazi regime now rules the globe with an iron fist.\n\nYou are Captain B.J. Blazkowicz, the American War Hero. After emerging into this world of darkness, you must launch an impossible counter-offensive against the monstrous Nazi regime. Only you dare stand up against an unstoppable army of Nazi robots and hulking Super Soldiers. Only you can stop Deathshead. Only you can rewrite history.",

                "name": "Battlefield 4",
                "description": "Battlefield 4™ is the genre-defining action blockbuster created by DICE, and made from moments that blur the line between game and glory – moments found only in Battlefield. Go to Boot Camp to learn the basics of Battlefield 4's engaging single player and intense multiplayer mode. Here you'll also find intel on Levolution, Commander Mode, Naval Warfare and many more exciting game features.\n\nStoryline:\nUnlike the Campaign of its predecessor, Battlefield 4's Campaign primarily follows chronological order, and permanently casts the player as Recker. In the beginning, set in Baku, Azerbaijan, Tombstone Squad—consisting of Recker, Dunn, Irish, and Pac—escapes the city, with vital intelligence in hand and Russian special forces in hot pursuit. The squad winds up trapped in a civilian's car when it plunges into the sea. Dunn, trapped between the seats and critically wounded, gives Recker his pistol and orders him to shoot out the windshield.[35] Reluctantly, Recker shoots the window, and Dunn drowns as the others escape. As Tombstone swims to the surface, the player hears their commanding officer, Captain Garrison, talking over the phone about the intel: that Admiral Chang is planning a military coup d'état, and if he succeeds, he will gain full Russian support, confirming an earlier report from an asset in China. Tombstone returns to the USS Valkyrie, an amphibious assault carrier en route to China's eastern coast. On board, Garrison informs them of the assassination of Chinese presidential candidate Jin Jié, and that Chang convinced the Chinese that the United States was responsible.\nGarrison sends Tombstone, with Recker as squad leader, on a covert mission in Shanghai to rescue three VIPs: Kovic, Hannah, and Hannah's husband. With Tombstone's help, Kovic takes his fellow VIPs to the Valkyrie by helicopter. Meanwhile, Tombstone takes a civilian tourist boat from the shore, just as an electromagnetic pulse fries all electric equipment in the area. Realizing that there are other civilian refugees stranded on boats around them, and against Pac's protests, Irish leads them to the Valkyrie. Aboard the Valkyrie, they head for the USS Titan, a Nimitz-class aircraft carrier that can assist them. Upon sighting the Titan, the Valkyrie finds it highly damaged by Chang's Chinese military. Garrison orders Tombstone, with Kovic as acting squad leader (Recker lost the position because he didn't stop Irish in Shanghai), to scour the wreckage of the Titan for vital intelligence before it sinks. Tombstone recovers a hard drive with data from before the Chinese missile attack and fight their way out against boarding Chinese soldiers. The Titan buckles under its own weight while sinking and splits in two, forcing Tombstone to jump ship. Making their way back to the Valkyrie with a hijacked assault boat, they find the carrier under siege by Chinese forces. They board it to repel the Chinese assault. Kovic is critically injured during the engagement, and puts Recker back in charge of Tombstone before he dies. Tombstone then clears the bridge and rescues Hannah's husband and Garrison.\nGarrison debriefs Recker and Pac on the upcoming assault on the Chinese-controlled Singapore airfield to destroy Chinese air superiority while their air forces are grounded by a storm. Hannah volunteers to join Tombstone, much to Irish's chagrin, as he wasn't involved in the debrief himself. They successfully assault the beach and lead an advance towards the airfield, losing most of their forces in the process. While crossing a bridge to the airfield, Recker is pinned behind by a car blown by the strong winds and tries to break free with the help of Tombstone, to no avail. A large freighter crashes into the bridge, throwing Tombstone into the sea below. They survive and make their way to the airfield via a sewer. After Pac fires the signal flare, Tombstone attempts to evacuate the area using an enemy vehicle, but they are knocked out of their vehicle when the missiles hit, apparently killing Pac. Hannah seemingly betrays the squad, bringing the Chinese soldiers to capture Tombstone; this infuriates Irish, but neither he nor Recker can stop the soldiers from incapacitating them.\nRecker and Irish are then taken to a prison in the Kunlun Mountains by the Chinese military. There, the two Marines are interrogated about their mission in Shanghai, with Chang personally watching, before being thrown into cells. Recker is awoken by \"Dima\", a Russian prisoner suffering from radiation poisoning. Recker helps Dima release the other prisoners, starting a mass riot throughout the prison and reuniting him with Irish. Although the prison guard is overrun, Chinese military arrive and launch an assault. Recker and Irish hold them off long enough for Dima to open the prison gates, only to be caught by Hannah and other soldiers. Hannah shoots the soldiers holding Recker, Irish and Dima at gunpoint; she explains that she had been tasked to protect Jin Jié, who had been posing as her husband. The group fight their way through the Kunlun Mountains to a cable car, which goes down the mountain. The tram is then shot down by an enemy helicopter, and the impact kills Dima.\nForced to continue on foot for two days, Tombstone makes their way down the mountain, forced to hunt for food to survive. They find a jeep and drive to Tashgar, under siege by both Chinese and Russian forces. While driving, Hannah explains that she'd brought Jin Jié to meet her family to give them hope, but that the next day, Chang's army came and killed them all; this mortifies Irish, and he apologizes to Hannah. They eventually find Major Greenland, who commands the remainder of U.S. ground forces in Tashgar. She states that the mobile anti-air that the Russians have are causing them to have a disadvantage. Tombstone volunteers to demolish the dam to flood the area, destroying the Chinese-Russian forces in exchange for a ride back to the Valkyrie. They successfully complete their task, and are sent to the Suez Canal.\nThey are picked up by a U.S. C-130 using the Fulton surface-to-air recovery system, and are then paradropped to the Valkyrie, which is sailing blindly into Admiral Chang's forces. Tombstone assists in clearing the deck of boarding Chinese forces and find Garrison, who is holed up with Jin Jié, other survivors, and Pac (who had survived Singapore, and escaped by \"crawling through a thousand miles of shit with a hole in [his] stomach\"). When Chinese forces finally reach the door to the medical bay, Jin Jié convinces Recker to let him show his face to the soldiers, as they had been fighting under the illusion that Jin Jié had been killed. Recker opens the door and is knocked down, but Jié calms the tension between the three forces showing his face to them. The Chinese soldiers celebrate the news of their leader's return and call off the attack.\nHowever, upon hearing this news, Chang barrages the Valkyrie with his warship, hoping to \"bury the truth and everyone with it\". With no ordinance to strike back, Recker, Irish and Hannah once again volunteer to manually destroy it with explosives. Driving a boat to the warship's blind spot, the trio set the remote charges and use grappling guns to bring them to safety under the Suez Canal Bridge before detonating the explosives. Unfortunately, the remote detonation fails, requiring manual replacement of the charges. Hannah volunteers to set a new charge, but Irish stops her, volunteering to do it himself because China will need Hannah. Recker—and the player—is forced to take two options: either do nothing as Chang's warship obliterates the Valkyrie, thus killing Pac, Garrison and Jin Jié; or to send either Hannah or Irish back down to set the explosives. As soon as the detonator lights green, Recker detonates the charges, destroying Chang's ship but killing whomever had gone down to make it possible. A U.S. rescue helicopter then picks up Recker and his remaining teammate, reporting to Garrison that one member is missing in action. During the credits, the player hears a new dialogue between Irish and Hannah, discussing their pasts, and how they have to keep moving forward with \"no fucking regrets\".",

A new chapter titled \"Rage Burst\" is added to the story, featuring content separated into six difficulty levels within the main quests. Rage Burst introduces a new game mechanism known as \"Blood Rage\", which involves filling an Awakening Gauge by attacking enemies, and then making a pledge to the God Arc once it activates, granting various buffs to the player. Temporary invincibility can be toggled during the pledge selection process, at the expense of draining the Awakening gauge. The game also introduces new characters, enemies and weapon types. The PlayStation 4 version supports 5.1 surround sound with positional sound effects, and NPC communication messages will be directed from the speaker located on the DualShock 4 controller.\n\nStoryline:\n\"Three years after the events of GOD EATER: Resurrection, a mysterious red rain sparks a fatal pandemic called the Black Plague. With no established cure, this scourge has a mortality rate of 100% once infected. Members of the Special Unit “Blood”, an affiliate of the Fenrir Organization, are sent to assist and investigate. Take control of their newest recruit as you master incredible weaponry, challenge enormous monsters, and cooperate with an iconic cast of characters fighting for humanity in GOD EATER 2: Rage Burst.\"",

At key moments during the game, up to four players can join together online to tackle a specific situation, with some stages seeing the usual partnerships swapped to further increase the depth of gameplay.Once players have completed the initial three campaigns they will unlock an all new campaign featuring Resident Evil’s very own femme fatale, Ada Wong. A single player experience, Ada’s campaign features unique missions, gameplay and weapons which will provide answers to the unanswered questions from the first three campaigns.",

The adventure, which spans eight chapters and two interconnected stories, features the hallmarks of MachineGames – thrilling action, immersive story and intense first-person combat. As war hero B.J. Blazkowicz, arm yourself with new weapons such as the bolt-action rifle and grenade-launching Kampfpistole as you attempt to thwart the advancing Nazi war machine, and take advantage of duel-wielding pipes that can be used for wall climbing – or for vicious take-downs of never-before-seen Nazi adversaries.\n\nStoryline:\nThe year is 1946 and the Nazis are on the brink of winning World War II. In an effort to turn the tide in the allies’ favor, B.J. Blazkowicz must embark on an epic, two-part mission deep within Bavaria. Part one of Wolfenstein: The Old Blood - Rudi Jäger and the Den of Wolves - pits BJ Blazkowicz against a maniacal prison warden as he breaks into Castle Wolfenstein in an attempt to steal the coordinates to General Deathshead’s compound. In part two – The Dark Secrets of Helga Von Schabbs – our hero's search for the coordinates leads him to the city of Wulfburg where an obsessed Nazi archaeologist is exhuming mysterious artifacts that threaten to unleash a dark and ancient power.",

                "description": "An action-RPG set in an imaginary world. A mysterious narrator moves the story forwards based on your every desicion in game and the paths you choose. You have an arsenal of upgradeable weapons at your disposal. Once you complete the main story you unlock a harder new game mode to continue your challenge.\n\nStoryline:\nThe game takes place in the aftermath of the Calamity, a catastrophic event that suddenly fractured the city of Caelondia as well as the surrounding areas of the game's world into many floating pieces, disrupting its ecology and reducing most of its people to ash. Players take control of the Kid, a silent protagonist who awakens on one of the few remaining pieces of the old world and sets off for the eponymous Bastion, where everyone was supposed to go in troubled times. The only survivor he meets there is an elderly man named Rucks, the game's narrator, who instructs him to collect the Cores that once powered Caelondia. A device in the Bastion can use the power of the crystalline Cores to create landmasses and structures, as well as enable the Kid to travel farther afield via \"skyways\" that propel him through the air. \n \nDuring his quest, the Kid meets two more survivors: Zulf, an ambassador from the Ura, underground-dwelling people with whom Caelondia was once at war; and Zia, an Ura girl who was raised in Caelondia. Both of them return to the Bastion, but upon reading a journal that the Kid discovers, Zulf intentionally damages parts of the Bastion's central device (the monument) and returns to Ura territory. The Kid learns that the journal belonged to Zia's father, Venn, who had worked for the Caelondians. He had helped Caelondian scientists (\"Mancers\") build a weapon intended to destroy the Ura completely to prevent another war. Venn rigged the weapon to backfire, so that when he was finally forced to trigger it, the resulting Calamity destroyed most of Caelondia as well. \n \nTo repair Zulf's damage to the Bastion, the Kid starts collecting Shards, a lesser form of Cores. As he obtains the penultimate shard needed, the Ura attack the Bastion, damaging it and abducting Zia. In the next seven days, The Kid engages in sporadic skirmishes in Ura territory. When he finally blasts through an Ura outpost and meets Zia, she tells him that she had left with the Ura voluntarily to find out their intentions; Rucks had previously told Zia that the Bastion had the ability to somehow fix the Calamity. The Kid travels to the once-underground Ura homeland to retrieve the last shard. There, he discovers Zulf being attacked by his own people: the battle with Kid has devastated the Ura forces, and they blame Zulf for bringing the Kid to their home. The Kid can choose to drop his weapon to help Zulf or leave him. If he leaves Zulf behind, the Kid destroys the remnants of the Ura and escapes through a skyway. If he chooses to carry Zulf, Ura archers initially open fire on them but ultimately cease fire and watch silently as the Kid and Zulf take the skyway back to the Bastion. \n \nAfter the Kid returns and recovers, Rucks gives him another choice: He can have the Bastion rewind time to before the Calamity in the hopes of preventing it, or use it to evacuate the survivors and move on to somewhere safe. Rucks is unsure if there is any way to prevent the Calamity from reoccurring if the time is rewound, as there was no way to test the process. The game ends either way, showing images of the characters (with the inclusion of Zulf if the player chose to rescue him) flying away or of their lives before the Calamity along with the credits. In the New Game+ mode, which is unlocked after beating the game once, it is hinted that restoring the world didn't prevent the Calamity.",

                "description": "This is an action game in which players assume the role of Jodie Holmes and her invisible companion \"Aiden\" through fifteen years of Jodie's life. From a third-person perspective, players control Jodie through fully interactive environments, choosing a variety of action-, dialogue-, and decision-paths based on on-screen prompts. Some choices can lead to depictions of violence: Jodie attacking assailants with punches, kicks, and various objects (e.g., tree branches and knives; impaling an enemy with a pipe). As the character Aiden, players solve puzzles, manipulate objects and attack (e.g., strangulation) Jodie's assailants. Players can also use Aiden to possess enemies and perform violent acts (e.g., shooting fellow SWAT members; crashing vehicles; performing self-inflicted gunshot wounds). Some of these sequences are accompanied by blood-splatter effects. In one cutscene, a bound character's eye is cut out during an interrogation—the act is obscured by a character's back. One prolonged bar sequence depicts three men attempting to rape a woman; players control Aiden and interact with objects to stop the assailants. Another sequence depicts a character propositioning a woman to perform fellatio. The game includes depictions of the central character drinking beer and smoking a marijuana in a party setting – screen distortion occurs during theses sequences. The words “f**k” and “sh*t” can be heard in the dialogue.\n\nStoryline:\nExperience the most striking moments throughout 15 years of Jodie’s life as she grows from a confused child into a crack CIA agent, and discovers who she really is. As she traverses the globe, Jodie will face incredible challenges set against a backdrop of emotionally-charged events never before seen in a video game. Create your own personal journey as your decisions and actions shape the course of the story.",

Inspiration for these changes seems to have come from 2005's God of War.\n\nStoryline:\nFrom Wikipedia: \nGabriel is sent by the Brotherhood of Light to the Lake of Oblivion, where his deceased wife, Marie, tells him that Spirits who founded the Brotherhood said that the Lords of Shadow's power will save the world. Gabriel meets a man from the Brotherhood called Zobek, who states that a prophecy has been kept a secret by a select few, which tells of a pure-hearted warrior who will claim the Lords of Shadow's power to overcome evil. Zobek says that he and Gabriel must enter the lands of the Dark Lords in order to unite the Heavens with the world again, and that with this Gabriel can bring Marie back from the dead. Gabriel defeats the werewolf Cornell and the vampire Carmilla for the first two pieces of the God Mask on his journey, while learning that they were once two of the three founding members of the Order who fought the spawns of Satan in God's favor until they transformed into the Spirits, with power only second to God's. After they ascended to the Heavens, they left behind their dark sides, who were known as the Lords of Shadow.",

Dark Souls will have many familiar features: A dark fantasy universe, tense dungeon crawling, fearsome enemy encounters and unique online interactions. Dark Souls is a spiritual successor to Demon’s, not a sequel. Prepare for a new, despair-inducing world, with a vast, fully-explorable horizon and vertically-oriented landforms. Prepare for a new, mysterious story, centered around the world of Lodran, but most of all, prepare to die. You will face countless murderous traps, countless darkly grotesque mobs and several gargantuan, supremely powerful demons and dragons bosses. You must learn from death to persist through this unforgiving world. And you aren’t alone. Dark Souls allows the spirits of other players to show up in your world, so you can learn from their deaths and they can learn from yours. You can also summon players into your world to co-op adventure, or invade other's worlds to PVP battle. New to Dark Souls are Bonfires, which serve as check points as you fight your way through this epic adventure. While rested at Bonfires, your health and magic replenish but at a cost, all mobs respawn. Beware: There is no place in Dark Souls that is truly safe. With days of game play and an even more punishing difficulty level, Dark Souls will be the most deeply challenging game you play this year. Can you live through a million deaths and earn your legacy?",

The Xbox 360 version of the game was released on June 14, 2007 in Japan, September 17, 2007 in North America, and October 19, 2007 in Europe. The game was also released on the PlayStation 3 with additional content as Trusty Bell: Chopin's Dream – Reprise (トラスティベル 〜ショパンの夢〜 ルプリーズ Torasuti Beru ~Shopan no Yume~ Rupurīzu?) on September 18, 2008[3] in Japan, and in North America on October 21, 2008,[4] and in Europe with the original name Eternal Sonata on February 13, 2009.[5] \n \nThe game is centered on the Polish romantic pianist and composer Frédéric Chopin, who died of tuberculosis at the age of 39. The story envisions a fictional world dreamed by Chopin during his last hours that is influenced by Chopin's life and music, and in which he himself is a playable character, among others. The game's battle system centers on musical elements and character-unique special attacks. Light and darkness play a part in the appearance and abilities of enemies on the battlefield, as well as the types of magic that can be cast.[6] \n \nThe game features a selection of Chopin's compositions played by pianist Stanislav Bunin, though the original compositions were composed and arranged by Motoi Sakuraba. It is notable for its use of classical piano pieces, educational cutscenes featuring real paintings and photographs (in contrast to the cel-shading graphics of the game) and lush landscape design.",

                "name": "Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker",
                "description": "MGS: Peace Walker is an action-adventure stealth video game and is the third action-based Metal Gear title made specifically for the PSP, following Metal Gear Solid: Portable Ops and its stand-alone expansion Portable Ops Plus, and the first in the series released for a portable platform to be directed by series' creator Hideo Kojima. This is the first title in the series to alter the traditional tagline \"Tactical Espionage Action\" to \"Tactical Espionage Operations\", referring to the base building and mission mechanics of the game. \n \nSet in 1974 in Costa Rica, the game follows the exploits of returning protagonist Big Boss (previously known as Naked Snake in Snake Eater and Portable Ops, now known simply as Snake) as he runs the mercenary unit Militaires Sans Frontières (Soldiers Without Borders). \n \nPeace Walker consists of two primary playing modes: \"Mission\" and \"Mother Base\". \"Mission\" are the actual action sequences of the game, where the player must infiltrate an enemy territory, whereas \"Mother Base\" is a crew managing simulation mode similar to the \"Comrade System\" in Portable Ops. \n \nMissions \nPlayers get to choose which missions to play from the \"Mission Selector\" screen. There are two main types of Missions: Main Ops are the primary story-based missions in which goals are determined by the narrative and must be played in a strict order in order to proceed. Some Main Ops missions include illustrated cutscenes that involve bits of interactivity in order to proceed. Extra Ops are optional side-missions that involve much more elaborate goals ranging from simple target practices to obtaining secret documents. \n \nWhen the player completes a mission, his or her performance is evaluated afterward. A player's score is penalized with a lower rank and reduced heroism for excessive killing and frequently being discovered, whereas players who are stealthy and subdue enemy soldiers non-lethally will be awarded appropriately. Players can replay previously cleared missions for higher ranks. \n \nPlayers can go through missions as Snake or as an MSF soldier (male or female). Some missions will only be available to Snake, and likewise for MSF soldiers. \n \nThe game adopts certain mechanics from Metal Gear Solid 4, such as the ability to move while crouched, the over-the-shoulder shooting view, the CQC system, and the ability to search held-up soldiers. The truck from Portable Ops, where players can bring subdued enemies for recruitment, has been discarded in favor of the Fulton Recovery System, which players attach to subdued soldiers and prisoners. The Wi-Fi recruitment system from Portable Ops has been modified so that instead of tapping the Circle button to obtain a strong enough signal from an access point, the player will have to knockout soldiers using CQC to accept them. The cardboard box used to hide from enemy soldiers is now available in two-man versions called Love Boxes, which have different variants. The Surround Indicator in Portable Ops can also be used only when it is equipped in the item box and players will also develop and use an early version of the Soliton radar system from Metal Gear Solid. The game features the camouflage index system from Snake Eater, but the player does not have the ability to change camouflage uniforms during a mission as the point index will be entirely based on movement, position, and the size of the weapon equipped in the weapon box. The player can also use marking devices to call in artillery strikes or resupply drops. \n \nMovement is done on the analog stick; actions such as co-op actions use the directional-pad; melee actions, which include multiple throws into crowds of enemies, use the R button; and weapons use the L button with the R button. Players will be unable to move or shoot while lying down and while pinned on a wall. The player can set the control system according to that of Portable Ops, Guns of the Patriots, or Capcom's Monster Hunter. \n \nBefore starting a mission, the player can determine his or her character's item and weapon load-out, including the character's uniform. The player's carrying capacity is limited and any excessive items that the player obtains during a mission will be transferred over to Mother Base's inventory. There are four primary types of uniforms that can be worn by the player. \n \nJungle Fatigues — The default uniform for Snake and MSF Soldiers. A balance of stealth, defense, weapons, and inventory. Available in multiple camouflage patterns. \nNaked — A shirtless version of the Jungle Fatigues, players using Naked uniforms move fast at the cost of lower stealth, weaker defense, and fewer items. \nSneaking Suit — Resembles the sneaking suit worn by Snake in Snake Eater and Portable Ops, it allows players to move without generating foot noises and have higher camouflage compared to other suits while moving, but restricts them to five items and six secondary weapons. \nBattle Dress — A heavily armored suit that allows the player to carry a third primary weapon and absorb heavy firepower, but at the cost of a lower item carrying capacity, slower mobility and a lower camouflage index. A variant outfitted with a helmet is also available, which increases the defenses. \n \nMother Base \nThe Mother Base is an abandoned OTEC research platform in the Caribbean that serves as the MSF's headquarters. Aside from managing the combat, medical, intelligence, and technology research teams seen in MPO, the player can assign personnel to the mess hall crew to feed the troops and keep up their morale. Rebellious or injured personnel can be brought to the brig and sickbay, respectively. The player will also have a chance to capture military vehicles that appear in the game as minor boss opponents, such as armored personnel carriers, tanks, and attack helicopters. Up to 350 soldiers can be recruited; excess staff caught in a mission must be discharged and up to 50 vehicles can be captured over the course of the game. \n \nItems and weapons are not procured on-site, but rather they're developed by MSF's R&D division based on blueprints obtained from missions. New items and weapons can only be developed when the player has sufficient GMP and certain MSF divisions have both reached the required level. Once development of an item has been completed, the R&D staff will automatically mass-produce them for the entire army. \n \nOuter Ops is a new game mechanic where players can deploy their combat unit soldiers (with the exception of Snake and other unique characters) and captured vehicles on certain missions against computer opponents. Each assault force codenamed from Alpha to Hotel has eight slots for assigning vehicles or soldiers, who can gain combat bonuses such as additional hit points and Psyche points, and generate income for the team. Depending on the scale of the enemy's firepower, MSF soldiers who are defeated during the battle can either die or be brought to sickbay for treatment. Vehicles that show damage in one mission will still show damage unless they are taken off the front for repairs, while decommissioned vehicles will be stricken from the inventory. \n \nMultiplayer \nThe Comrade System from Portable Ops has been removed in favor of a cooperative play mode called \"Co-Ops\", which allows two players to play most sneaking missions and four players in boss missions. There are several actions that can take place when two players are next to each other. 'Snake-in' allows players to hold on to each other as one player leads the way, also allowing the players to fire on the move. Other co-operative actions include holding up closing doors, performing CPR on fallen comrades, sharing items, and acting as a spotter for other players whose vision is obscured. \n \nVersus Ops are multiplayer matches played over special versions of certain maps. The player has a choice of whether to organize individual or team deathmatches, base capture and quetzal capture missions. Only certain items or weapons unlocked in the single-player campaign can be used in the mode. Each match can gather up to six players with restrictions included, such as life and psyche points not regained and limited time for CPR revivals.\n\nStoryline:\nFour years after the events of the San Hieronymo incident, Big Boss—who prefers his original title, Snake—and Kaz Miller have established Militaires Sans Frontières, a small mercenary faction, on the Colombian coast. They are approached by Ramon Galvez Mena, a professor at the University of Peace, and his student, Paz Ortega Andrade. Galvez attempts to hire MSF to investigate an army that has discreetly occupied parts of Costa Rica. Snake refuses, identifying Galvez as a KGB agent, but is convinced when Paz plays a recording of The Boss. \n \nWhen Snake arrives in Costa Rica, he begins to suspect that the mystery army has brought nuclear weapons with them. Enlisting the help of the Sandinista Liberation Army, he tracks a shipment to a research facility deep in the mountains. His suspicions are confirmed when he witnesses Hot Coldman, a senior CIA agent, announce his intentions to fire a live nuclear weapon as part of a project code-named \"Peace Walker,\" a fail-deadly nuclear tank. Snake reveals himself to Huey Emmerich, one of Peace Walker's designers, who agrees to help him stop Coldman. \n \nFollowing Huey's instructions, Snake ventures deeper into Costa Rica, searching for Dr. Strangelove, the designer of Peace Walker's artificial intelligence systems. He discovers that Strangelove has based Peace Walker's primary control systems on The Boss' personality. She demands to know whether The Boss genuinely defected to the Soviet Union, or if she died on a mission that was covered up, going so far as to torture Snake for information. \n \nSnake escapes custody and attempts in vain to destroy Peace Walker, a quadrupedal nuclear launch platform. He chases Peace Walker across the Nicaraguan border to an American airbase on the shores of Lake Cocibolca. Discovering that the base has been occupied by Soviet soldiers, Snake infiltrates the facility to confront Coldman. Coldman reveals the purpose of Peace Walker: he believes that nuclear deterrence is a flawed theory, relying on humans to retaliate in the event of a nuclear exchange, whom he believes to be unwilling to destroy their own race. As an impartial artificial intelligence, Peace Walker would guarantee retaliation, and Coldman intends to fire a warhead to prove it. Suddenly, the facility is overrun by Soviet soldiers, led by Galvez, who reveals himself as Vladimir Zadornov. Zadornov intends to hijack Peace Walker for the Soviet Union, but the standoff is broken by the arrival of MSF and the Sandinistas, giving Snake enough time to destroy Peace Walker. \n \nIn the aftermath of the battle, Zadornov is captured and Coldman mortally wounded. In his dying moments, Coldman activates Peace Walker's data uplink, convincing NORAD that the United States is about to be hit by a Soviet nuclear strike. Snake contacts NORAD, and tries to convince them to stand down, but senior members of the armed forces refuse and plan to retaliate. With a nuclear strike imminent, The Boss' personality takes control of Peace Walker's damaged artificial intelligence and drowns Peace Walker in Lake Cocibolca, severing the connection and ending the threat. \n \nSome time later, Zadornov repeatedly escapes from MSF, arousing Snake's suspicions that someone has betrayed them. Paz reveals herself to be the traitor, using Zadornov's escapes to seize control of Metal Gear ZEKE, a walking tank designed by Huey to act as MSF's deterrent against foreign intervention. Acting as an agent of Major Zero—now using the name \"Cipher\"—Paz issues Snake an ultimatum: surrender MSF to Cipher and become his deterrent, or else she will fire a nuclear warhead on America, at which point they will be branded a nuclear-equipped extremist cult, and the world will unite in their pursuit of MSF. Snake prevents the launch by crippling ZEKE, and Paz is thrown into the ocean. In the aftermath, Snake reconciles with his memory of The Boss and accepts the title of Big Boss as he rallies the soldiers of MSF to prepare for a fight for their survival, declaring them to be living in \"Outer Heaven\".",

                "description": "Ratchet & Clank Future: A Crack in Time (known as Ratchet & Clank: A Crack in Time in most PAL countries) is a platform game developed by Insomniac Games and published by Sony Computer Entertainment for the PlayStation 3 video game console. It is the sequel to Ratchet & Clank Future: Tools of Destruction and Ratchet & Clank Future: Quest for Booty.] The game was released for the PlayStation 3 in North America on October 27, 2009, in Australia on November 5, 2009 and in Europe on November 6, 2009. \nA fourth installment, titled Ratchet & Clank: Into the Nexus, was released in November 2013 for the PlayStation 3.\n\nStoryline:\nContinuing from the end of Quest for Booty, Clank has been abducted by the Zoni to a place called the Great Clock on behalf of the robot Dr. Nefarious, who is trying to discover the secret of the facility from him. Nefarious attempts to access Clank's memory banks for the key to something called the Orvus Chamber but is not allowed to do so because of the Zoni. Nefarious then sets free his Hypersonic Brainwave Scrambler, causing the Zoni to flee and a blackout to occur. When the power is restored, Clank has awoken and attempts to escape, but is caught by Nefarious and his butler, Lawrence and promptly immobilized. \nClank awakens later to find himself with a robot named Sigmund who is the Junior Caretaker of the facility, with no sign of Nefarious and his troops. Through the use of stations called mnemonic chambers that tap into his memory banks, Clank learns that the Great Clock was constructed by the Zoni scientist Orvus as a means to heal damage to the universe caused through excessive misuse of time-travel. A portion of Orvus still resides in Clank's memory banks, put there when Clank was constructed by the Zoni so that one day Clank would be able to take up the mantle of Senior Caretaker, with the help of the Zoni. Clank also learns that his father left for an outpost on Zanifar and never returned to the Clock. \nMeanwhile, Ratchet and Qwark explore the Breegus System for information on Clank and Nefarious. They learn of an \"exile\" that is also fighting Nefarious, and trace the being down to another Lombax, General Alister Azimuth. While exploring Krell Canyon for an Obsidian Eye to talk to Clank, Azimuth tells Ratchet he knows of his parents and that it was his fault that Emperor Tachyon was able to come to power, having shared the Lombaxes' technical genius with him. When the Lombaxes left for another dimension, Azimuth was forced to stay behind as punishment for his \"crimes\". Azimuth also tells Ratchet about the Great Clock, and that they may be able to use it to bring back the Lombaxes to this universe. After speaking to Clank through an Obsidian Eye and saving Qwark from a war grok named Snowball, Ratchet uses a time portal on Zanifar to find out what happened to Orvus. Nefarious captured the Zoni to try and get into the Orvus Chamber, but failed after Orvus vanished into thin air. Ratchet managed to make his escape and save Azimuth from Nefarious's henchman, Lord Vorselon. (But not before altering Nefarious's appearance by giving his past self a permanent scar on his right eye) \nRatchet and Azimuth manage to free Clank from another group of Nefarious's henchwomen, the Valkyries. Clank then manages to persuade Ratchet that Azimuth's plan to use the Clock would inevitably destroy the universe, prompting Azimuth to leave sadly. Ratchet, Clank & Qwark then launch a stealth mission aboard Nefarious' base, but are eventually caught. Before launching Ratchet and Clank on an asteroid into deep space, Nefarious reveals that he plans to use the Great Clock to go back in time to foil the various heroes across the universe and create a present where villains always reign supreme. Ratchet and Clank's asteroid crashes into a nearby planet (Planet Morklon) though the two are unharmed due to the Zoni protecting them. They see the world they landed on was destroyed. A surviving fongiod named Yurik reveled this was cause by the Agorians ten years ago and told the story of the battle of Gimlick Valley. One day Agorians suddenly attacked the peaceful village and captured many Fongiod villagers. The tribe leader and an army of soldiers were put together to fight, only for the tribe leader to get killed and the Agorians destroyed the dam wiping out the Fongoid village. They use a similar time portal from Zanifar to rescue the Fongoids of the past ten years ago to the battle of Gimlick valley. They enter combat with Agorians saving child Yurik who tells Ratchet to save the prisoners. After freeing the prisoners with help from the Fongoids, they confront Commander Argos, an Agorian general who was piloting his ship. The duo destroy the ship as it sinks into the dam. Fongoids cheered in victory and then the duo returned to the present where they see a different more peaceful village of Gimlick valley. Where the duos surprise are giant hedges memorial of the duo and is the 10 year anniversary of the day the duo save the Fongiod village. The duo meet with a Fongiod who they ask to borrow the memorial ship that Argos used during the battle that apparently has been recovered and repaired since it fell into the dam. The duo return to Nefarious to face him again before he can reach the Clock. They are able to defeat him aboard his ship, but Lawrence manages to slip away in the escape pod as the ship veers off course towards Nefarious's base. Just as the ship is about to impact, Azimuth arrives to rescue Ratchet and Clank. As the duo run towards Azimuth's ship, Nefarious's ship crashes into it and destroys the base. \nThe group returns to the Great Clock, where Clank is ready to resume his duties. However, Ratchet & Clank both refuse Azimuth the chance to use the machine to bring back the Lombaxes. Azimuth suddenly snaps, furious that Ratchet no longer wants what he does. His ambition turns to corruption and he fires his weapon at Ratchet, knocking him over the edge of the platform and killing him. While Clank manages to give chase to the General, Sigmund tries to stop him, but Azimuth overpowers him, and then Clank locks himself in the Orvus Chamber to prevent Azimuth from getting in. Remembering the words of The Plumber that he wouldn't risk any more than 6 minutes, Clank initiates a time shift to go back in time six minutes, where he is able to push Ratchet out of way of Azimuth's blast and alter the events. Ratchet and Azimuth then race though a grind rail to get into the Orvus Chamber. The duo are too late and Azimuth activates the Clock to shift backwards to try to bring the Lombaxes home. Ratchet then fights Azimuth with the fate of the entire universe in the balance. As he and Ratchet fight, the Clock starts to fall apart around them, unable to take the strain of such a massive shift. As Ratchet shouts at him to stop what he's done, Azimuth realizes his mistake. He tells Ratchet to \"take care of himself\" and gives his own life to stop the Clock from self destructing by using his wrench to replace the broken lever and turning it. However, by doing it, he gets hit by a lethal energy blast from the broken Clock and dies. \nAfter the Zoni repair the chamber, Ratchet bids Clank a farewell, wishing him well as he walks away. Clank, hearing the recorded words of Orvus again, realizes he cannot stay because he cannot leave Ratchet until he finds his family since Ratchet's actions helped find Clank's home. Clank promotes Sigmund to Senior Caretaker and, as Orvus says in the background that his son can do whatever makes him feel whole as he rejoins Ratchet just as he's about to leave. Together, they soar into the stars for another adventure.",

The game allows you to use two bots to fight along side you, which can be upgraded over time with better weapons and firepower.\n\nThere are 10 total weapons in the game, significantly less than the other games. However, modding these weapons is more emphasized than before, with different kinds of Alpha and Omega mods. Omega mods can be used on any weapon, and range from the freeze mod to the magma mod. Alpha mods are weapon-specific, and increase the rate of fire, ammo capacity, and power. The game also features online multiplayer.\n\nClank is not a playable character in this game, although he gives advice to Ratchet over his communication link.\n\nStoryline:\nThe storyline involves Ratchet and Clank, along with Al, being kidnapped and forced to compete in a underground reality show called \"DreadZone\" run by the media mogul Gleeman Vox on the outer fringes of the galaxy.",

Along the way, the Horseman discovers that there are far worse things than an earthly Apocalypse, and that an ancient grudge may threaten all of Creation. \n \nDarksiders II follows the exploits of Death, one of the four horsemen of the Apocalypse, in an action-packed tale that runs parallel to the events in the original Darksiders game. This epic journey propels Death across an expansive gameworld as he tries to redeem his brother, War, the horseman blamed for prematurely starting the Apocalypse in Darksiders. \n \nLike the original Darksiders game before it, the second iteration of the series is primarily a hack 'n slash adventure. The game takes place across netherworld environments, including 'The White city', an outpost where angels live, and 'The Eternal Throne', a floating fortress where the Lords of the Dead stand guard over souls that need to be cleansed. Although Death is the most feared of the Four Horsemen, his physical abilities are very different than his brother, War. Death is far more nimble, and relies on a combination of melee and ranged attacks. In combat Death's primary weapon is his huge iconic scythe, with a wide range of other weapons and usable items that must be gathered as the game progresses. Weapons can be dual-wielded, upgradable armor can be acquired for protection and Death has access to his terrifying and powerful mount, Despair.",

The world of The Surge offers a very grim vision of the future, where the evolution of our technology, our society and our relation with the environment led to a decadent state of the Human civilization. \n \nFitted with an advanced CREO exo-suit, balancing your core power against your implants and exo-suit upgrades will allow you to specialize in a huge variety of combat styles, thanks to the almost limitless combinations of addons and dozens of make-shift weapons salvaged from the industrial complex. Finely tune your gear to match your playstyle, and to best suit the challenge ahead. The Metroidvanian levels open up as your core power increases, allowing you to over-charge doors previously too strong for your suit to damage and opening new pathways for you to explore. The CREO facility is vast, and if you want to find and craft the best equipment and weapons, you will need to search every area for secrets and hidden items. \n \nThe Surge features innovative combat mechanics, allowing you to target individual limbs and dismember the exo-suit add-on or weapon you want to acquire. Collecting tech-scrap and blueprints, you will be able to return to the Operation Center to level up and craft new exo-suit addons and weapons salvaged throughout the level. The most powerful of these can be acquired from the world’s gigantic, industrial bosses. Most of what you encounter in The Surge was never originally designed to kill you, and most of the items you loot and craft were never meant for combat. However, the combined strength of the exo-suit and near-future technology of CREO mean that anything from fork-lifting addons to laser cutters can be used as lethal weapons for diving deeper into the facility.",

                "description": "The story begins with the main protagonist, Tidus, waiting with his allies outside the ruins of an ancient city. Tidus narrates the events that led to the present, spanning most of the game's storyline. It begins in Tidus's home city, the high-tech metropolis of Zanarkand, where he is a renowned star of the underwater sport blitzball. During a blitzball tournament, the city is attacked by an immense creature which Auron, a man not originally from Zanarkand, calls \"Sin\". Sin destroys Zanarkand, taking Tidus and Auron to the world of Spira. \nUpon arriving in Spira, Tidus is rescued by Al Bhed salvagers in the area. Upon asking him where he is from, one of them, Rikku, tells him that Sin destroyed Zanarkand 1,000 years ago. After Sin attacks again, Tidus is separated from the divers and drifts to the tropical island of Besaid, where he meets Wakka, captain of the local blitzball team.Wakka introduces Tidus to Yuna, a young summoner about to go on a pilgrimage to obtain the Final Aeon and defeat Sin; and her guardians, Lulu and Kimahri. Meanwhile, Tidus joins to help Wakka in the upcoming blitzball tournament to find a way back home. The party travels across Spira to gather aeons, defending against attacks by Sin and its \"offspring\"—fiends called Sinspawn. After the tournament, they are joined by Auron, who convinces Tidus to become Yuna's guardian. He reveals to Tidus that Yuna's father, Lord Braska; Tidus's father, Jecht; and himself made the same pilgrimage to defeat Sin ten years ago. Tidus thought his father had died at sea ten years earlier. Following another attack from Sin, they are joined by Rikku, later revealed to be Yuna's cousin. \nWhen the party arrives in the city of Guadosalam, the leader of the Guado, Seymour Guado, proposes to Yuna, saying that it will ease Spira's sorrow. At Macalania Temple, the group sees a message from Seymour's father Jyscal, who declares he was killed by his son, who now aims to destroy Spira. The group reunites with Yuna to engage Seymour in battle, killing him;[36] soon afterward, Sin attacks, separating Yuna from the others. While searching for her on Bikanel Island, the homeland of the Al Bhed where they had surfaced, Tidus has an emotional breakdown when he learns that summoners die after summoning the Final Aeon, leading to his desire to find a way to defeat Sin while keeping Yuna alive. The group finds Yuna in Bevelle, where she is being forced to marry the unsent Seymour. They crash the wedding and escape with Yuna. The group is captured at the Bevelle temple, and are ordered to stand trial. After escaping from their sentence, the group heads towards the ruins of Zanarkand, seen in the introduction of the game. \nOn the way there, Tidus learns that he, Jecht, and the Zanarkand they hail from are summoned entities akin to aeons based on the original Zanarkand and its people. Long ago, the original Zanarkand battled Bevelle in a machina war, in which the former was defeated. Zanarkand's survivors became \"fayth\" so that they could use their memories of Zanarkand to create a new city in their image, removed from the reality of Spira. One thousand years after its creation, the fayth have become exhausted from \"dreaming\" their Zanarkand, but are unable to stop due to Sin's influence. \nOnce they reach Zanarkand, Yunalesca—the first summoner to defeat Sin and unsent ever since—tells the group that the Final Aeon is created from the fayth of one close to the summoner. After defeating Sin, the Final Aeon kills the summoner and transforms into a new Sin, which has caused its cycle of rebirth to continue. Yuna decides against using the Final Aeon, due to the futile sacrifices it carries and the fact that Sin would still be reborn. Disappointed by their resolution, Yunalesca tries to kill Tidus' group, but she is defeated and vanishes, ending hope of ever attaining the Final Aeon. After the fight, the group learns that Yu Yevon, a summoner who lost his humanity and mind, is behind Sin's cycle of rebirth. This leads the group to infiltrate Sin's body to battle Seymour and Jecht's imprisoned spirits. With Sin's hosts defeated, Tidus' group battles and defeats Yu Yevon. Sin's cycle of rebirth ends, and the spirits of Spira's fayth are freed from their imprisonment. Auron, revealed to be unsent, goes to the Farplane, having died years ago after confronting Yunalesca. Just then, Dream Zanarkand and Tidus disappear, now that the freed fayth stopped the summoning. Afterward, in a speech to the citizens of Spira, Yuna resolves to help rebuild their world now that it is free of Sin. In a post-credits scene, Tidus awakens under water. He then swims towards the ocean surface, and the screen fades to white.\n\nThe HD remaster covers both Final Fantasy X and its sequel Final Fantasy X-2. The first game follows the journey of the teenager Tidus who is transported to the world of Spira after an encounter with a creature known as Sin. He becomes one of the guardians of the summoner Yuna, protecting her on a pilgrimage to defeat Sin and finding out how the creature is linked to Tidus' and Yuna's late fathers.[7][8] Gameplay relies on the Conditional Turn-Based Battle system that allows for swapping party members in mid-combat. Characters are leveled up by means of the Sphere Grid on which the player may choose a specific skill to learn or attribute to improve.[9] The second game is set two years after the events of X and features Yuna as a treasure hunter in search of spheres leading her to Tidus.[10] It reintroduces the series' classic job system in the form of the Garment Grid: jobs can be acquired as dresspheres, costumes that give the player characters different abilities, throughout the game and may be changed in battle.[11] X-2 includes multiple minigames such as Sphere Break and blitzball, the latter of which also featured prominently in X.[12] \nWhile the majority of the gameplay for X and X-2 remains unchanged, the games have undergone an extensive graphical update and a large amount of the music for X has been rearranged. All regional releases contain content from the International versions: X has the expert Sphere Grid and several optional bosses, while X-2 comes with extra dresspheres and new minigames. The Creature Creator system was added, whereby players can capture enemy monsters and certain non-player characters (NPCs) to train them and to have them fight alongside the party in battle, similar to the Pokémon series: these captured allies can also be fought and strengthened in a coliseum. Lastly, X-2 includes the \"Last Mission\" extra dungeon that plays in the style of a roguelike 3D game, having a grid-based layout across which the characters move and take on enemies. Layouts are generated randomly and each opponent is allowed as many turns as the player has taken. As in the main game, the player characters can equip jobs in the form of dresspheres. Dialogue between the protagonists changes depending on which ending the player achieved in X-2. The Eternal Calm movie that bridges the gap between X and X-2 is included in the collection as well.[4][13][14][15][16][17] The collection allows for cross-platform saving between the PlayStation 3 (PS3) and PlayStation Vita versions and both games have full trophy support.[14][18] \nFinal Fantasy X: Will is an original audio drama included in the release, playing during the ending credits.[19] It features multiple characters from the games, alongside two new characters: the narrator Chuami and her companion Kurgum.[20] In the story, the two are sent to summon Yuna to investigate a mysterious phenomenon known as \"Beckoning\", where the dead are being called back into existence. On their journey, they encounter a reborn Sin, who has apparently been beckoned.[21][22] Over the course of the story, it is revealed that Tidus is suffering from some kind of weakness,[23] and that Yuna and he appear to have broken up and Yuna is seeing someone else.[24] The drama ends with Yuna preparing to face Sin again and Tidus, despite his weakness, deciding to follow her.",

Both PC and PS4 versions include previously released DLC.\n\nThe game is set in fictional Europa, loosely based on Europe during the early years of World War II. Because of its abundance of Ragnite ore, which takes the place of petroleum in the game setting, the neutral nation of Gallia comes under attack from the East Europan Imperial Alliance, which is itself engaged in war with the Atlantic Federation. Players take control of a unit of the Gallian Militia, dedicated to repelling the invasion. The game's visuals, which use Sega's CANVAS graphics engine, resemble pencil drawn paintings in motion.",

                "description": "Overview\n\n￼Sony PlayStation 4\n\nThe PlayStation 4 is the fourth video game console produced by the Sony Corporation, and was released November 15th in North America and November 29th in Europe and Australia. It uses the x86 processor and 8GB of GDDR5 memory, making it much more PC-like (and easier to code for) than Sony's previous console, the PlayStation 3. It is capable of streaming games via Gaikai's streaming service, and features options such as gameplay video sharing, instant game resume from hibernation, a robust social network-like friends list, PS Vita integration & remote play, and background uploading and downloading. The new controller also gives players new input options via a touchpad and motion sensor light bar.\n\nFor the first time on a Sony console, a paid membership to their PlayStation Plus program will be required to play online multiplayer on the PS4. Free-to-play & subscription-based games are however exempt, as are other online services such as Netflix. A single PS+ membership applies across the PS Vita, PS3, and PS4 consoles.\n\nDuring Sony's Gamescom 2014 briefing, the company announced that as of August 10th 2014 they had sold 10 million PS4 units to consumers. On March 3, 2015 Sony revealed the console had surpassed 20 million PS4 units sold to consumers.\n\nAnnouncement\n\n￼\n\nSony officially announced the PlayStation 4 on February 20, 2013 at a 2 hour event called PlayStation Meeting 2013, which was hosted by Andrew House & held at the Hammerstein Ballroom in New York City.\n\nThe hardware specifications and interface of the new console were presented by Mark Cerny, who also showed off the newly redesigned DualShock 4 controller.\n\nGaikai CEO, David Perry, took the stage to talk about the potential their streaming and cloud gaming service can bring to the console.\n\nVarious developers then took the stage to show a few of the games & concepts being developed for the platform, including DriveClub, Killzone: Shadow Fall, Watch_Dogs, The Witness, and inFamous: Second Son. The console itself was not revealed at this event.\n\nLaunch Console & Software\n\n￼￼PlayStation 4 console\n\nThe public got its first look at the console on stage at Sony's press conference at E3 on June 10th, 2013, where it was revealed that it will cost $399 (US), contain a 500GB hard drive, and be packed with a controller and headset (ear bud + cord mic).\n\nOn August 20th 2013 at Gamescom in Germany, Sony revealed the console would be released November 15th 2013 in the US and November 29th in Europe.\n\nLaunch Software\n\nThe following games launched with the PS4:\n\nAngry Birds Star WarsAssassin's Creed IV: Black FlagBattlefield 4Blacklight: RetributionCall of Duty: GhostsContrastDC Universe OnlineEscape PlanFIFA 14flOwFlowerInjustice: Gods Among UsJust Dance 2014Killzone: Shadow FallKnackLEGO Marvel Super HeroesMadden NFL 25NBA 2K14NBA Live 14Need For Speed: RivalsPlayroomResogunSkylanders: Swap ForceSound ShapesSuper MotherloadSwitch Galaxy UltraTrine 2: The Complete StoryWarframe\n\nPS4 Apps\n\nThe PlayStation 4 launched with the following digital entertainment apps in North America:\n\nMusic UnlimitedVideo UnlimitedNetflixHuluAmazon Instant VideoCrackleCrunchyrollEPIXNBA Game TimeNHL GameCenterRedbox InstantVuduYuppTV\n\nDualShock 4 Controller\n\n￼￼Mark Cerny reveals the DualShock 4 during the PlayStation Meeting 2013.\n\nThe PlayStation 4 uses the DualShock 4 controller. It is similar to previous DualShock controllers at first glance, but it contains a few significant additions & alterations:\n\nTouch Pad - The center of the controller now features a touch pad in the center, capable of dual-touch input.Speaker & Headphone Jack - Below the touch pad is an external speaker for game sounds, and on the bottom of the controller is a headphone jack for headset communication.Light Bar - At the top of the controller is a color-changing light bar that is used in conjunction with the PlayStation 4 Eye to detect the movement & position of the player, very similar in function to the PlayStation Move controller.New Buttons - The hallmark \"Start\" & \"Select\" buttons that existed on every other PlayStation controller have been completely removed, with two new buttons flanking either side of the touch pad: Share button - To the left of the touch pad is the Share button, which allows players to upload gameplay screenshots & video with people on their friends list or on social media services.Options button - To the right of the touch pad is the Options button, which serves the function of the old Start button, for things like pausing the game and bringing up the in-game menus.Analog Sticks & Triggers Re-designed - The analog sticks are now concave, and the L2 & R2 buttons are more trigger-shaped, more similar to both the Dreamcast and Xbox 360 controllers.\n\nThe DualShock 4 is available in Jet Black during the launch of PlayStation 4, and in Wave Blue and Magma Red on November 29th for Europe and before the end of 2013 for North America\n\nGaikai Integration\n\nSony is leveraging its $380 million acquisition of the cloud service Gaikai in the PlayStation 4. Gaikai CEO Dave Perry announced that the service will be fully integrated with the new system to provide background downloading of games, streaming of game content, and potentially providing backwards compatibility with the PS1, PS2 and PS3 libraries in the future. A major feature will be the ability to play instant demos on the new system, without the need to download files locally. Upon further clarification with Shuhei Yoshida, president of Worldwide Studios of Sony Computer Entertainment, not all games on the system will contain this feature, but Sony is \"highly recommending\" implementation. In addition, the Share functionality of the PS4 is tied to Gaikai, allowing for players on the system to share their gameplay to social networks such as Facebook and Ustream.\n\nSony announced during their 2013 E3 press conference that the service would not be available at launch, but would be available sometime in 2014. The open beta for Playstation Now, the game streaming service powered by technology from Gaikai, began on July 31st 2014 in North America. It's only on the PS4 for now, but the company said it plans to later expand the service to other Sony gaming platforms.\n\nPlayStation 2 Emulation\n\nMonths before its official announcement at PlayStation Experience 2015 on Decemeber 4th, rumors of PS2 emulation for the PS4 begin to surface. On November 19th, Sony confirmed the existence of the PS2 emulation technology after the release of the PS4 Star Wars Battlefront bundles on November 17th, which came with four Star Wars games, three of which were PS2 games (Star Wars: Race Revenge, Star Wars: Jedi Starfighter, and Star Wars: Bounty Hunter.)\n\nEight games were released during it's initial launch for $9.99 or $14.99:\n\nGrand Theft Auto 3Grand Theft Auto: Vice CItyGrand Theft Auto: San AndreasDark CloudThe Mark of KriTwisted Metal: BlackWar of the MonstersRogue Galaxy\n\nThey are neither HD Remasters or PS2 Classics releases like on the PS3. Unlike HD remasters, they do not have physical retail releases, only digital. Even the Star Wars game that come with the Battlefront bundles are vouchers for digital codes. Also, these games run on emulation unlike HD Remasters which are ported to run natively on the PS3 hardware. However, unlike the PS2 Classics, these are up-scaled to 1080p, run at higher frame-rates, supports trophies as well as PS4 social and connectivity features such as Live Broadcast, Share Play, and Remote Play.\n\nHardware Specifications\n\nPDF released by SCEI on February 21, 2013 after announcing the consolePDF released by SCEI on June 10, 2013 following Sony's E3 press conference, with additional system specs\n\nMain Processor\n\nSingle-chip custom processor\n\nCPU: x86-64 AMD â€œJaguar,â€� 8 cores\n\nGPU: 1.84 TFLOPS, AMD next-generation Radeonâ„¢-based graphics engine\n\nMemoryGDDR5 8GB (Unified)Hard Disk Drive\n\n500 GB (Built-in, user-replaceable)\n\nExternal Dimensions\n\n275Ã—53Ã—305 mm (width Ã— height Ã— length) (tentative)\n\nOptical Drive\n\n(read only)\n\nBlu-ray 6xCAV\n\nDVD 8xCAV\n\nI/OSuper-Speed USB (USB 3.0) port x2, AUX port x1\n\nCommunication\n\nEthernet (10BASE-T, 100BASE-TX, 1000BASE-T)\n\nIEEE 802.11 b/g/n\n\nBluetoothÂ® 2.1 (EDR)\n\nAV output\n\nHDMI OUT port\n\nDIGITAL OUT (OPTICAL) port\n\nIncluded\n\nPlayStation 4 system x1\n\nWireless DUALSHOCK 4 controller x1\n\nMono headset x1\n\nAC power cord x1\n\nHDMI cable x1\n\nUSB cable x1\n\n",

                "description": "Overview\n\nThe PlayStation 3 (PS3) was officially unveiled at Sony Computer Entertainment America's Electronic Entertainment Expo press conference on May 16, 2005. When it was initially announced, Sony stated that it would be part of a longer cycle for consoles, stating that it would be part of a ten year cycle.\n\nSony initially announced two hardware configurations for the PlayStation 3: The 60GB and the 20GB, though the 40GB, 80GB, 120GB, 160GB, 250GB and 320GB configurations have been released since then. The PS3 was announced for a simultaneous worldwide release with a launch date of November 11, 2006 for Japan and November 17, 2006 for the United States and Europe. But due to a shortage of the blue laser diodes used for the Blu-ray Disc drive, the European launch was subsequently delayed to March 23, 2007.\n\nThe PS3 uses the Cell Broadband Engine co-developed by Sony, IBM, and Toshiba. Graphics processing is handled by the NVIDIA RSX 'Reality Synthesizer', which can output resolutions up to 1080p HD. The PS3 has 256 MB of XDR main memory and 256 MB of GDDR3 video memory for the RSX, for a total of 512 MB system memory.\n\nSince its launch, the PS3 has a worldwide install base of over 80 million units.\n\nLaunch\n\nThe system was released in North America on November 17th, 2006 (November 11th in Japan, March 23rd in Europe). The launch of the PlayStation 3 proved to be a rather difficult one for many reasons. One was the high price point for the console; $599 for the 60GB model in the US. Another was the launch line-up and the infamous E3 2006 press conference which failed to impress gamers, and instead started many internet memes, like Giant enemy crab and Massive damage. Finally, the marketing campaign \"Play B3yond\" was negatively received for its approach and weirdness, mostly concerning a TV spot featuring a plastic baby, laughing and finally crying watching a PS3. The North American launch line-up was the following:\n\nCall of Duty 3Genji: Days of the BladeMadden NFL 07Marvel: Ultimate AllianceMobile Suit Gundam: CrossfireNBA 2K7NBA 07Need for Speed: CarbonNHL 2K7Resistance: Fall of ManRidge Racer 7Tiger Woods PGA Tour 07Tony Hawk's Project 8Untold Legends: Dark Kingdom\n\nHardware Configurations\n\n20 GB Model (discontinued)\n\n￼The Original PlayStation 3 ( non 20gb model)\n\nThe 20 GB was available at launch in Japan on November 11th 2006, in North America on November 17th 2006.The 20 GB PS3 has a slot loading 2x speed Blu-ray Disc drive that plays Blu-ray movies, DVDs, CDs, and SACDs. It has built-in Bluetooth 2.0, a Gigabit Ethernet port, 4 USB 2.0 ports, and HDMI 1.3a. The 20GB PS3 also has backwards compatibility with PlayStation 1 & 2 titles through hardware emulation. The 20GB PS3 had an MSRP of $499.99 USD. It was discontinued on April 11th, 2007 due to poor sales compared to the 60 GB.\n\n60 GB Model (discontinued)\n\nThe 60GB PS3 was launched in Japan on November 11th 2006, then in North America on November 17th 2006. It has all of the features of the 20GB model plus 802.11b/g Wi-Fi, a multiple flash card reader, and a chrome finish. The original MSRP was $599.99. It was discontinued on July 13th, 2007.\n\n60 GB Model PAL (discontinued)\n\nThe PS3 launched with a 60 GB model in Europe on March 23rd 2007. An important difference between the European and American 60 GB model was the backwards compatibility. Unlike the American version, PlayStation 2 backwards compatibility was carried out via hardware and software emulation, foreshadowing the eventual 80GB model. The RRP of this model was â‚¬599.\n\n80 GB Model (PS2 backwards compatible, discontinued)\n\nIn August 2007, Sony released an 80 GB model of the PS3 in the US, which included backwards compatibility. This was enabled by using software emulation to emulate PS2 games. Because, it was software based, it only allowed for ~60% of PS2 titles to be played with no issues.\n\n40 GB Model (discontinued)\n\nThe 40 GB PS3 was launched in Europe/Australia in October 2007 and North America/Japan in November 2007. The 40 GB model had the multiple flash card reader and SACD supported removed, and is not backwards compatible with PlayStation 2 titles but is still compatible with original PlayStation titles. The 40 GB PS3 had a MSRP of $399.99. For a limited time only, Spider-Man 3 was packaged along with the 40 GB model.\n\n80 GB Model (discontinued)\n\nAnother 80 GB PS3 was launched in August 2008 in North American and Japan in October 2008. It sports all of the features of the 40 GB model and has an MSRP of $399.99 . At Sony's Gamescom 2009 keynote, Kaz Harai announced that the standard PS3 pricepoint is to be reduced by $100 to $299.99 as of August 19, which at the time applied to both this and the 160 GB model.\n\n160 GB Model (discontinued)\n\nThe 160 GB PS3 was announced at the Leipzig Games Convention in August 2008. The model will be coming to North America in November as part of a bundle which includes Uncharted: Drake's Fortune, a voucher for a free download of PAIN and a DualShock 3 for $499.99. This model will be released in Europe on October 31 for the cost of â‚¬499 RRP ($628) but will be packed with â‚¬70 ($88) worth of additional DLC.\n\nE3 Model (never released)\n\nInterestingly enough, the original model shown off at the Electronic Expo in 2005 boasted a couple of different features. The original planned configuration was to have at least 2 HDMI ports and up to 6 USB ports (2 ports on the back). This was later cut down to four for the launch and the HDMI ports cut down to one, with the reasoning being that there was actually no need for so many ports. It was shown in three different colors; white, silver, and piano black, but only black was available for launch. It was also sporting the now infamous boomerang controller, but that design was scrapped in favor of the more traditional DualShock design.\n\nSlim 120 GB Model (discontinued)\n\n￼The PlayStation 3 Slim\n\nThe Slim 120 GB model of the PS3 was announced at Gamescom 2009 by Kaz Harai at Sony's keynote on August 18. The new model is 33% smaller and 36% lighter, and consumes 34% less power. The Slim shares mostly the same features as the most recent SKU's. The one notable exception, however, is that the ability to install a second operating system was removed. Also, there was a stand introduced to support it when vertically oriented, similar to the PS2 Slim, though it has been shown to be unnecessary. This model was released on September 1, 2009 at an MSRP of $299.99 in the U.S., Â£249.99 in the U.K. and â‚¬299.99 in the rest of Europe.\n\nSlim 250 GB Model (discontinued)\n\nThis is identical to the 120 GB model except for hard drive capacity, and it retailed for $349.99 when released on November 3, 2009 in the U.S. There was also a white Final Fantasy XIII bundle in Japan released on December 17.\n\nSlim 160 GB Model\n\nThis is identical to the 120 GB model except for hard drive capacity, and it retailed for $299.99 when released in August 2010 in the U.S.\n\nSlim 320 GB Model\n\nThis is identical to the 120 GB model except for hard drive capacity, and it retailed for $349.99 when released on September 19, 2010 in the U.S. This system also comes as a PlayStation Move bundle, including the game Sports Champions.\n\n\"Super Slim\" 250GB Model\n\n￼￼PS3 \"Super Slim\"\n\nAnnounced at TGS 2012 and released on September 25 in North America, the PS3 \"Super Slim\" is the 3rd and most likely final version of the PS3. it's less than half the size and weight of the original PS3 and 20 percent less volume and 25 percent less weight of the Slim PS3. It includes a 250GB hard drive and retails for $269 USD. For a limited time, Uncharted 3 game of the year edition and a $30 voucher Dust 514 will be included in the package.\n\n\"Super Slim\" 500GB Model\n\n￼￼\n\nThe \"Super Slim\" 500GB model is exactly the same as the 250GB model, except it has double the hard drive space. It retails for $299 USD and was released in October in North America. For a limited time, Assassins Creed III will be included in the package.\n\nDeveloper Relations\n\nDeveloper Kits\n\nThe developer kits originally cost $20,000 each, and they were cut down to $10,000 sometime in 2008. Now the PS3 developer kit has been price cut again to $2,000, a drop of 80%.\n\nSony Pub Fund\n\nAt GDC '09, Sony announced a new initiative for PlayStation Network titles allowing developers to self-publish games on the platform. If you make a downloadable game exclusively for PSN, Sony will guarantee royalties by reimbursing development costs as well as supplying support for game design and marketing. They also insist that the developer will still retain control of the intellectual property and set pricing. Burn Zombie, Burn, was the first title released on PSN under this initiative.\n\nAccessories\n\n￼￼What could have been\n\nThe PlayStation 3 currently has many different first and third party accessories.\n\nSony first launched the PS3 with the Sixaxis. It charges its built-in lithium ion battery via USB cable and has a battery life of roughly thirty hours fully charged. It connects to the system via Bluetooth and lacks any sort of rumble function. Originally, Sony's reason for this was that they found the motion control functions of the controller to be more immersive than the rumble function and they were technically unable to combine them at the time. Although it is more likely due to the lawsuit from Immersion. The two games that were used to demonstrate the motion capabilities of the system were Lair and Warhawk.\n\nDualShock 3\n\n￼￼DualShock 3\n\nAt its press conference at the 2007 Tokyo Game Show, Sony announced the DualShock 3 because despite Sony's original belief that the controller didn't need rumble, the fans asked. This was a PlayStation 3 controller with the same function and design as the Sixaxis, but with the vibration capability included. It has a lithium ion battery as well with a battery life of roughly 25 hours, and it charges via USB. Similarly to the Sixaxis, this controller connects to the PlayStation system via Bluetooth. Because of the added functionality of the rumble, the controller weighs more then it's older brother.\n\nOfficial PlayStation Bluetooth Headset\n\nThe official Sony PS3 headset\n\n￼￼\n\nThis headset is compatible with cellphones and the PS3. After firmware update 2.50, it supports a visual volume level cue, along with the current battery charge. It comes with a USB docking station used for charging the headset. It can be paired via Bluetooth or USB cable. The headset launched bundled with SOCOM: Confrontation. However, it can also be purchased separately for an MSRP $49.99.\n\nA new version of the headset was released in November 2010. The new features include a smaller and lighter package, noise cancellation, better device compatibility and better transmit and receive sound.\n\nBluetooth Remote\n\nFor those who do not like using the Sixaxis or DualShock controllers while watching their movies can use the standalone Bluetooth remote released by Sony. It has all the functionality of the regular controllers minus the ability to use it while playing a game, and is in a regular controller form.\n\nPlayStation Eye\n\nThe PlayStation Eye is the successor to the EyeToy, and is a camera with a built-in microphone array. This accessory was originally packaged with the game The Eye of Judgement. In addition to simply capturing video and audio, it can also be used for motion control.\n\nWireless Keypad\n\n￼￼Keypad attached to the controller\n\nA wireless keypad was added as an accessory in December 2008. It is designed for faster text messaging and PS3 compatibility. It is a separate Bluetooth device, with its own battery and it connects to the and sticks over the top side of the DualShock 3 controller. It comes with certain preset buttons for friends list and with a touchpad for \"quicker and better\" internet browsing. Response to the keypad has been mixed, with some complaints due to its small buttons with no back light and dodgy touchpad.\n\nAC Adapter\n\n￼￼Sony PlayStation AC Adapter\n\nThe PlayStation AC Adapter is a USB based charger that plugs into an ordinary wall outlet. It's designed to charge the Sixaxis controller, the DualShock 3 controller, the Bluetooth headset and the wireless keypad, all without the need to turn on your PlayStation. You can also charge your controller while playing your PlayStation, something you can't do with some other aftermarket controller charging docks. It will also charge the PSP-2000 and PSP-3000. The AC adapter retails in the United States for $24.99 and the United Kingdom for Â£19.99.\n\nPS3 sound bar\n\n￼￼\n\nReleased in October, 2010, with a MSRP of $179.99, the official PS3 sound bar is a 2.1 channel audio device that mimics surround sound systems. The system has 2 sound settings \"Dynamic\" and \"Night\". The night setting attempts to enhance key sounds when the volume is low.\n\nPlay Television TV Tuner\n\nA TV tuner accessory which connects to the PlayStation 3 and allows the system to be used like a DVR, and record your favorite TV shows directly onto the PlayStation hard drive. This accessory is currently only available in Europe.\n\nPlayStation Move\n\n￼￼PlayStation Move\n\nAt E3 2009, Sony introduced the unnamed motion controller to the mass market via a few impressive tech demos. The wand has a colored orb on top that is tracked by the PlayStation Eye and sensors within, which combine to allow true one-to-one tracking. At Sony's 2010 GDC keynote, it was announced that the official name would be the PlayStation Move. A sub-controller was also revealed, dubbed the \"Navigation Controller.\" The navigation controller has no sensors, so a DualShock controller can be used as a substitute for the navigation controller if the user is prepared to deal with the slightly uncomfortable grip one must use to operate the DualShock in conjunction with the wand controller.\n\nWireless PS3 Stereo Headset\n\n￼￼\n\nPlanned for release in September 2011, with a MSRP of $99.99. It's an alternative option to the PS3 sound bar above. It's a 2 channel system, but simulates 7.1 channel audio. It also has a built in mic for online chat.\n\nPlayStation Network\n\nThe PlayStation Network, or PSN, is Sony's free online service which allows PS3 and PSP owners to communicate with each other, play games, compare trophies, and download content from the PlayStation Store. As well as giving access to the interactive lobby and game launching system, PlayStation Home. Recently, the ability to display your Trophy collections on internet forums was added through the official PlayStation web site. To get this new feature, you sign in with your PSN ID, under the network tab and then it syncs to you PS3 and downloads all the information. From there, you choose your favorite game, your mood, as well as leave a little comment, and then you can post it on any forum as a signature.\n\nSignificant Firmware Updates\n\n￼￼The PlayStation 3 XMB\n\nFirmware 1.60, released in May 22, 2007, added the Folding@Home client.

Also the ability to eject a game using the controller was added. As a final feature keyboard support for the browser was added.\n\nFirmware 2.00, released November 8, 2007, added many new features.

Another significant feature added with this update was PlayStation Trophies, which were a greatly requested feature. There was some buzz about this firmware causing problems for certain console owners, so it was taken down, and only a short while later, a revised version, Firmware 2.41, was released on July 8th 2008.\n\nFirmware 2.50, released October 15, 2008, added automatic shut down for the PS3 system and the controllers. It also added support for the official Sony Bluetooth headset which allows high quality voice chat and displays current volume level and battery. More features were also added to trophies, and a percentage was added to the user level.\n\nFirmware 2.60 released January 21, 2009, added video playback of files encoded with version 3.11 of DivX.

Additional changes:\n\nFriends list on the XMB (XrossMediaBar)\n\nSort your friends via their online statusAttach larger files to the messages you send to your friends (file size will increase from 1MB to 3MB)\n\nVideo delivery service on PlayStation Store\n\nVideo files youâ€™ve purchased from the PlayStation Store can be backed up to an external storage device and then restored to PS3â€™s internal hard drive for playback â€“ so you can clear up space on your hard drive and then restore the video anytime in the futureVideos youâ€™ve purchased for PSP system can now be transferred to PS3 for playback\n\nFirmware 2.80, released July 20, 2009, increased the maximum limit of characters in Text Chat from 32 to 64 per line and wireless controllers got prioritized assignment over peripherals.\n\nFirmware 3.00 was announced on August 18, 2009 at Sony's Gamescom conference and released on September 1, 2009. The major changes in this update are:\n\n￼￼\"What's New\" (middle) and \"Status Indicator\" (top right)â€œWhatâ€™s Newâ€� â€“ The â€œInformation Boardâ€� will be replaced with a â€œWhatâ€™s Newâ€� section, which presents you with interactive PlayStation news every time you start the PS3 system. Located under the PlayStation Network icon, â€œWhatâ€™s Newâ€� displays the latest and greatest game, video, PlayStation Network and PlayStation news and releases, as well as your recently played games.Status Indicator â€“ In the top right corner, theyâ€™ve added an indicator bar, which displays your user icon, friend icon, the number of friends you have online and a small message icon to let you know if you have any new messages.

Base and add-on game trophies continue to be combined into a single list so you can see where you stand in a game as a whole. Within that list, trophies are broken out into subcategoriesâ€”base trophies and add-on trophiesâ€”allowing the player to differentiate progress in base and add-on trophies.\n\nFirmware 3.10, released November 19, 2009, added Facebook integration including : trophy notification, PlayStation store purchase notification and special in-game notifications. Coloring has been added to the user personal profile which is reflected on the Friends List backdrop. The photo menu in the XMB has been modified to allow pictures to be viewed in a grid allowing for easier access and viewing.\n\nFirmware 3.21, released April 1, 2010, was a controversial update because Sony decided to remove the \"Install Other OS\" option on fat PS3s (the slim ones already shipped without the feature installed).\n\nThe reason for this was due to security concerns. Sony was afraid that people would begin to pirate PS3 games after a breakthrough was made possible through the use of Linux as a secondary OS in the systems.\n\nFirmware 3.30, released April 22, 2010, includes support for future stereoscopic 3D games and multiple ways to list your trophies and compare them with friends.

                "description": "Overview\n\n￼Nintendo 3DS \n\nNintendo announced the Nintendo 3DS on March 23, 2010. No software was yet revealed; the only details in the announcement were that the system will be available in Japan by the end of March 2011, and that it will display stereoscopic 3D without requiring special glasses, and it is backwards compatible with existing DS and DSi software. The system itself was revealed at Nintendo's E3 2010 media briefing by Satoru Iwata.\n\nThe 3DS's graphical capabilities are said to be comparable to the Wii, but the added benefit of modern shaders. This is in addition to stereoscopic 3D, adding a sense of 3-dimensional depth to the image. The 3D can be adjusted with a slider to fit each person's individual eye focus. Much like the volume slider, turning the 3D slider all the way down disables the 3D effect altogether.\n\nThe 3DS also features two cameras, allowing the user to take 3D images. The 3DS can also play downloaded 3D movies, and can connect wirelessly to the internet to access the Nintendo eshop and video streaming/download services.\n\nNote: Install base in the platform details tab (50.98 million units) reflects the latest official cumulative Nintendo 3DS platform family LTD numbers minus the latest New Nintendo 3DS/XL LTD numbers (8.81 million units). The total LTD numbers of the entire Nintendo 3DS family (including New Nintendo 3DS/XL) is 59.79 million units. Sales figures current as of June 30, 2016.\n\nNintendo 3DS\n\nSpecs & Features:\n\nWidth: 5.3\" (13.4cm), height: 2.9\" (7.4cm), depth when folded: 0.8\" (2.1cm)Weight: ~8 ounces (235g)Top Screen: 3.5\" parallax barrier LCD screen with 800x240 resolution. 3D capability.Bottom Screen: 3\" LCD screen with 320x240 resolution.

It offers an additional Circle Pad on the right and extra ZL/ZR shoulder buttons. The Circle Pad Pro requires one AAA battery to function.\n\nPorts:\n\n3DS game card slot (also accepts DS games)SD memory card slotAC adapter portStereo headphone jack\n\nWireless:\n\nSupports IEEE 802.11 networks with WPA/WPA2 securityCan communicate with other 3DS units automatically and can stay connected all the time.\n\nNintendo 3DS XL\n\n￼3DS vs 3DS XL\n\nDuring a Nintendo Direct presentation, Nintendo announced the 3DS XL (known as 3DS LL in Japan) which features 90% bigger screens and longer battery life while retaining all the features of the regular 3DS. The Nintendo 3DS XL launched in North America on August 19, 2012 (for US$199,99) and July 28 in both Europe (â‚¬199,99/Â£179.99) and Japan (Â¥18,900) as well as Australia/New Zealand on August 23, 2012 (for AU$249,95).\n\n46% size increase (width: 15.6cm, height: 9.3cm, depth when folded: 2.2cm, weight: 336g)90% bigger screens (top screen: 4.88 inches, bottom screen: 4.18 inches)Size of the +Control Pad, face and shoulder buttons has been slightly increasedbattery life increased to between 3.5 to 6.5 hours (3DS software) and 5 to 8 hours (DS software)bundled SD Card upgraded from 2GB to a 4GB CardIncludes an updated Stylus that is not retractable and rests at the side again, akin to DSlite/DSiAC power adapter sold separately in Japan and Europe, bundled in North AmericaCompatible with DSi/DSiXL/3DS AC adapterAll user data (including activity log, play coins, NNID/eShop activity) can be transferred from the original 3DS to the 3DS XL, using System TransferDS and Virtual Console games that are selected to run in 1:1 native resolution will look better due to the bigger screen size, fixing a major complaint about the original 3DSNintendo has released a XL version of the Circle Pad Pro.Weighs almost 50 percent more than the original model 3DS. (336 grams compared to the original 3DS's 230 grams)\n\nNintendo 2DS\n\n￼￼Nintendo 2DS \n\nOfficially revealed by Nintendo on August 28th, 2013 via press release, the 2DS is second revision of the 3DS. The main differences are that the top screen does no longer displays stereoscopic 3D at all, and the system does not have a clamshell design like the 3DS and 3DSXL before it. The 2DS was released on October 12th, 2013 in North America for US$129.99, Europe for â‚¬129.99/Â£109.99, and Australia/New Zealand for AU$149.95 and was released in South Korea, in a bundle with PokÃ©mon X/Y, on December 7th, 2013 for 180,000 won (~US$170).\n\nWidth: 14.4cm (5.7\"), Height: 12.7cm (5.0\"), Depth: 2.03cm (0.80\"), Weight: 260g (9.2oz)Can play all 3DS games and DS games.Despite not having a 3D screen, it still has two cameras on the rear so it can take 3D photos and videos.Both screens are the same size as the original (not XL) 3DS.Shares the same software as the 3DS/3DSXL, except the WiFi toggle was put in with the screen brightness controls on the home screen.Comes with a 4GB SD card.Has a 1300mAh battery, the same as the 3DS, and lasts around 3 to 5.5 hours (3DS software) and 5 to 9 hours (DS Sofware).Because of the non-clamshell design, the 2DS has a \"sleep mode\" switch on the bottom.\n\nNew Nintendo 3DS/ New Nintendo 3DS XL\n\n￼￼New Nintendo 3DS & New Nintendo 3DS LL\n\nThis fourth model of the Nintendo 3DS was announced by Nintendo president Satoru Iwata in a Nintendo Direct on August 29, 2014.\n\nNew Nintendo 3DS comes in both the classic pocket-size of the original Nintendo 3DS and an XL variant. The New Nintendo 3DS adds a variety of buttons, features, refinements.\n\nThe New Nintendo 3DS models launch in Japan on October 11, 2014. The New 3DS will retail for 16,000 Yen and the New 3DS LL will retail for 18,800 Yen.\n\nThe new models will launch in North America and Europe in 2015.\n\nNew Nintendo 3DS will receive exclusive software taking advantage of the new CPU and new control options, notably a New 3DS version of the Wii RPG Xenoblade Chronicles. There will also be future games compatible with the previous Nintendo 3DS models that will be enhanced when played on a New Nintendo 3DS/XL. Existing games will not benefit from these enhancements.\n\nFurther details on the New Nintendo 3DS platform page.\n\nFirmware Updates:\n\nMarch 27th, 2011 (1.1.0-1)\n\n3D music video (OK Go) auto installedImproved network and system stability\n\nJune 6th, 2011 (2.0.0-2)\n\nRemoves 3D music videoNintendo eShop app3DS internet browser appDSi transfer toolSpotPass works in Sleep modeImproved Nintendo Camera appNavigation and system stability improvements\n\nJune 15th, 2011 (2.1.0-3)\n\nSystem stability improvementsAutomatic firmware updates via Wifi\n\nJune 25th, 2011 (2.1.0-4)\n\nSystem stability improvements\n\nNovember 13th, 2011 (2.2.0-X) - On game carts\n\nAbility to join friend's online games via the Friend's listSystem stability improvements\n\nDecember 6th, 2011 (3.0.0-5)\n\nUpdates to Nintendo Camera allows 3D video and 3D stop motionSpotPass function to StreetPass Mii PlazaAccomplishments to StreetPass Mii PlazaFind Mii IISlideshow for completed Mii Plaza puzzlesNew puzzle panelsDemos added to Nintendo eShopDLC for gamesDownload software from eShop while in sleep modeOption to save Credit Card info as well as only adding the amount of funds to pay for selected softwareNintendo 3DS transfer functionQR function in Nintendo CameraNintendo Zone app installed\n\nDecember 21st, 2011 (3.0.0-6)\n\nSystem stability and performance improvementsMinor StreetPass Mii Plaza performance improvements\n\nApril 24th, 2012 (4.0.0-7)\n\nDevelopers are now able to patch retail gamesAdded support for folder creation.

The concept of 3D intrigued them, and they continued experimenting ways to make it a serious way to play over the next 20 years. For every single new console they have made, they have tried to introduce some sort of 3D functionality. Most of these attempts weren't announced due to they not being up to their standards, especially after the commercial flop of the Virtual Boy in 1995.\n\nIt wasn't until it came time to create the successor to the Nintendo DS that they found a way to utilize it. The 3DS did not actually begin development as a 3D focused console, but instead it was just meant to be a successor to the DS with next-gen graphics, which Miyamoto called \"the typical evolution of a game device.\" However, without a good 'hook' to justify the release of a new console when the DS and its revisions were becoming the most popular game systems ever made, the system was pushed back until they felt it was appropriate.\n\nMiyamoto and Iwata wanted to include 3D in this new console, but they had to make sure it was there from the outset, and not released as an add-on peripheral to the device in order to increase the audience for it from the beginning. By the time the 3DS was being planned, LCD devices that could output autostereostopic images (where 3D images can be displayed without the need for 3D glasses) were already in development, and Nintendo decided to be one of the first to try the technology out.\n\nThe developers at Nintendo were astonished by the new technology, with Miyamoto calling it the same feeling when he saw Yoshi first appear on the 16-bit screen of the Game Boy Advance back during its development. Miyamoto also said it alleviates many of the harder parts of developing 3D games, especially Mario games, where a lot of effort has to be made to make the three-dimensional world that Mario traverses to be easily interpreted by the player.\n\n￼￼The 3D slider.\n\nAccording to him, they had to use many tricks to make it easy for the player to hit a floating '?' block in previous 3D Mario games, but when they experimented on the 3DS, it became very natural. He said it was the perfect time to bring back their previous franchises that started out in 3D to the 3DS, because it would allow him to create easier to play, yet more difficult sequels to the original games.\n\nTo Iwata, the 3DS is a means to bring 3D from being 'about impact', to being 'about depth', to be a serious part of the gameplay and the experience, instead of a simple gimmick. The 3D slider on the 3DS was created by request of Miyamoto and his engineers to have all kinds of people be able to enjoy the 3D graphics without experiencing double vision of blurry images due to their unique spacing between eyes, which has been in problem with many 3D movies, where the 3D is already set to a pre-set certain focus.\n\n3D and Graphical Capabilities\n\n￼￼An illustration showing how the 3D screen works.\n\nUnlike other 3D equipment, the 3DS does not require the use of 3D glasses. This is due to its auto-stereostopic ( parallax barrier) screen, capable of showing two different viewpoints of the same image at the same time. The screen has twice the horizontal pixel density of any other screen, which allows one set of lines aimed at one eye, while the other set is aimed at the other. The 3DS renders a single frame twice, each a different viewpoint, interlaced between each other vertically. Because of this, each eye will see a different frame, and your brain puts both of the frames together as a 3D image.\n\nThis results in the game actually running at half the frame rate that it's running internally; to make a 60 fps game on the 3DS, the developer would need to be able to make it run at 120 fps in 2D. However, this does not take up half the power of the console, which is just an urban myth. Several games support two different framerates: 60fps in 2D mode and 30fps in 3D mode while a select few manage to run at 60fps in 3D mode such as Mario Kart 7 and The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds. This shows the advanced power of the hardware, which is capable of rendering high end shaders, lighting, shadows, textures, fur, bump mapping, normal mapping, and other effects in real time with ease.\n\nOther Features\n\nAvailable on the 3DS eshop is a virtual console library which includes Game Boy, Game Boy Color, Game Gear, and NES games.\n\nThe 3DS supports Miis, including a Mii Maker feature that allows the 3DS to take a picture of the user or someone in the vicinity such as a friend or family member to use as a guide for Mii creation.\n\nOther built in software includes:\n\nNintendo 3DS Camera - similar to DSi Camera, but with more features - including the ability to take pictures in 3D using the dual camera lenses on the system's top shell. Also supports the scanning of QR codes.Nintendo 3DS Sound - Audio playback application similar to DSi Sound with support for mp3 and AAC types with .m4a, .mp4 and .3gp extensions.StreetPass Mii Plaza - A version of the Mii Plaza which shows the Miis of other 3DS users encountered in StreetPass Mode (See below) and allows for their use in small games like Find Mii (A small RPG) and a Puzzle GameFace Raiders - An Augmented Reality Game where photos of the user or friends are placed onto balloons which fly around the environment as the player attempts to shoot themAR Games - An app which interacts with the bundled AR Games cards to provide access to various Augmented Reality functions such as placing 3D models of characters such as Mario in the environment or playing a number of advanced AR GamesActivity Log - Functions similarly to the feature seen on the Wii's Message Board, but is more advanced. In addition to game playing time, also tracks steps with the built-in pedometer (And therefore allows players to earn Coins, a system-level pervasive currency which can be used to unlock content in games) amongst other thingsGame Notes - By pressing the Home Button, the player can pause the game and use this system app to write things down using the touchscreen.Notifications - Notifies users of things like StreetPass Data having been shared or new SpotPass data being downloadedDownload Play - Allows players to partake in single-card Multiplayer Games from those games which support this feature (Such as Super Street Fighter IV 3D Edition)Friends List - While it still uses a variation of the heavily criticized friend code system, players only need to register one single friend code which works on a system wide level instead of codes for every single title like on older systems, making the process far easier than before. It is also possible to directly join a friend's multiplayer session via the \"join game\" button in the friend list.Web Browser - A web browser that can run while a game is suspended in the background, letting players browse the web for tips, etc if they're stuck in a game.Miiverse - Nintendo's social \"empathy\" network made its way onto the 3DS via a firmware update in December 2013. It lets the 3DS access the service's features for games with communities on Miiverse and post drawings, text and (if supported) screenshots from the game. However, the 3DS version of Miiverse does not support messaging between friends.\n\nStreetPass\n\nStreetPass is a functionality built in to the 3DS. If multiple 3DS systems which are powered on or in sleep mode were to come within a certain range of one another, they share data. This data includes the Mii data built-in to the system as part of the 'StreetPass Mii Plaza', allowing them to trade puzzle pieces or fight in the RPG mini-game 'Find Mii'. The feature is also supported by games. Users can choose to opt-in to StreetPass functionality for individual games. A bit of saved data then appears system-level to share it (so you don't need to be in sleep mode within the chosen software). A 3DS system is able to have up to 12 Apps/Games having StreetPass enabled at a time.\n\nSpotPass\n\nSpotPass is the ability for the 3DS to seek Wi-Fi signals and automatically download content while in sleep mode. This allows games and the system itself to download updates and share data such as leader-board scores in a whisper-net like manner, free from user input.\n\nLaunch Titles\n\nJapan launch titles:\n\nCombat of Giants: Dinosaurs 3DNintendogs + CatsProfessor Layton and the Mask of MiraclePuzzle Bobble 3DRidge Racer 3DSamurai Warriors ChronicleSuper Street Fighter IV 3DWinning Eleven 3D Soccer\n\nUSA launch titles:\n\nAsphalt 3DBust-a-Move UniverseCombat of Giants: Dinosaurs 3DLEGO Star Wars III: The Clone WarsMadden NFL FootballNintendogs + CatsPilotwings ResortPro Evolution Soccer 2011 3DRayman 3DRidge Racer 3DSamurai Warriors: ChroniclesThe Sims 3Steel DiverSuper Monkey Ball 3DSuper Street Fighter IV 3DTom Clancy's Ghost Recon: Shadow Wars\n\nEurope launch titles:\n\nAsphalt 3DLEGO Star Wars III: The Clone WarsNintendogs + CatsPilotwings ResortPro Evolution Soccer 2011 3DRayman 3DRidge Racer 3DSamurai Warriors: ChroniclesThe Sims 3Super Monkey Ball 3DSuper Street Fighter IV 3DTom Clancy's Ghost Recon: Shadow WarsTom Clancy's Splinter Cell 3D\n\n3DS Colors\n\nModel / ColorJapanNorth AmericaEuropeAustraliaCosmo BlackFebruary 26, 2011 (disc.)March 27, 2011March 25, 2011March 31, 2011Aqua BlueFebruary 26, 2011 (disc.)March 27, 2011March 25, 2011March 31, 2011Flare (JP)/Flame (US)/Metallic Red (EU)July 14, 2011September 9, 2011September 30, 2011September 22, 2011Misty/Pearl/Coral/Lavender PinkOctober 20, 2011December 4, 2011December 16, 2011November 17, 2011Ice WhiteNovember 3, 2011 (disc.)-November 17, 2011-Cobalt BlueMarch 22, 2012---Midnight Purple-May 20, 2012--Light BlueMarch 20, 2013---Gloss PinkMarch 20, 2013---Metallic Red (JP)June 13, 2013---Clear BlackOctober 10, 2013---Pure WhiteOctober 10, 2013---On May 11th, 2012, Nintendo Japan announced that Aqua Blue would be ending production in that territory.On September 13, 2013, Nintendo Japan announced that the Cosmo Black launch model and the Ice White model are also being discontinued.

The 3DSs served as a replacement of the museum's previous audio guides that had become outdated. The 3DS serves both as a map and an audio tour. It contains over 35 hours of dialog in several different languages explaining the different works of art in the museum. It has since been released as a fully featured product on the eShop and was even made available in physical retail format exclusively at the Louvre's gift shop.\n\nThe Louvreâ€™s managing director HervÃ© Barbaret had this to say about the use of the 3DS at the Louvre\n\nThrough this partnership, we wanted to bring together heritage and the innovative world of interactive entertainment through a system many people are already familiar with. We feel that the Nintendo 3DS is perfect to achieve this goal... we believe that the new audio guide is a valuable tool that will help visiting the Louvre a more dynamic and rewarding experience, particularly for those that are not so familiar with a museum environment.\n\n",

                "description": "PlayStation Network\n\nThe PlayStation Network is the online platform that Sony uses for their PlayStation 3, PlayStation Portable (PSP) and PlayStation Vita (PSVITA) systems. There is no fee to become a user and use all of its features.\n\nPlayStation Store\n\n￼\n\nThe main source of distribution of content on the PlayStation Network is through the PlayStation Store. The PlayStation Store provides different kinds of content, such as games, demos, trailers, themes, wallpapers, add-ons, music, television shows, and movies, either for free or for a fixed price. The PlayStation Store is updated every Tuesday with new content, and on special occasions like E3 it is updated off-schedule.\n\nSony Entertainment Network Web Store\n\n￼\n\nIn January 2013, Sony launched the Sony Entertainment Network web store in the United States, allowing users to purchase games, movies, and television shows using their computers. Purchased content is simply added to the download list on the user's PlayStation 3 and/or PlayStation Vita. Sony has said that it will add automatic download functionality in the future.\n\nPlayStation Store for PC\n\n￼￼Media Go's Game Store\n\nThe Media Go management program has a storefront within it, but as the software is meant for PSPs and Sony-Ericsson phones, it cannot access PS3-only content. All PSP products can be accessed, purchased, downloaded, and transferred. Anything from the video store can either be pushed to PSP or viewed/kept on the PC. Digital Comics from a multitude of publishers are also available, but unlike videos, they cannot be viewed on a computer and must be transferred to the PSP.\n\nPayment Methods\n\n￼￼Your PSN account.\n\nUnlike some other online platforms that use points as a means of currency, the PlayStation Store uses the same currency of the country in which the user resides. There are different kinds of payment methods accepted on the PlayStation Store. When you add funds onto your account, those funds are stored in your \"Wallet\". Different methods of adding funds include:\n\nCredit CardPre-Paid CardPLAYSTATION Network Card\n\nIt should be noted that as of Winter 2008 major retailers such as Walmart, Target, and GameStop carry the PlayStation Network Cards. The cards come in denominations of twenty and fifty dollars.\n\nPSP PlayStation Store\n\nThe PlayStation Store was integrated with the PSP in October of 2008. As a part of the PSP update 5.00, PSP users are able to access the store right from their handhelds to download games and media right to their memory stick. This store is the same as the one available for PC. It is important for Sony's strategy to continue to push digital distribution with the PSN so that PSP games will be available day and date to download off the store. The PSP Go is dependent on this due to its lack of a UMD drive.\n\nLife with PlayStation\n\n￼￼\n\nOn June 26, 2008, Sony announced Life with PlayStation. It is a free service that features a 3D globe where users can zoom in on certain sections to find the weather and news headlines of that area. At E3 2008, Sony also announced that Life with PlayStation will also allow users to upload videos from their games straight to YouTube. Life with PlayStation was released on September 18, 2008.\n\nPlayStation Home\n\n￼￼\n\nOn December 11, 2008, PlayStation Home moved into the public beta stage. Home (for short) is a 3D social network available for free on the PS3, through the PlayStation Network. It features a virtual world in which users can design an avatar, purchase virtual items, play dozens of games, use the Game Launching feature, watch movies, chat with one another, and do plenty of other things. For game developers, Home is primarily used as a way to let fans interact with certain franchises via Home Spaces, areas dedicated to specific themes.\n\nPlayStation Plus\n\nOn June 29th, 2010, Sony launched a premium subscription service called PlayStation Plus through Firmware Update 3.40.\n\nFeatures include:\n\nHour long downloadable demos of full versions of select retail games (which can be purchased afterwords while retaining player progression and trophies)Select free PSN games, PSOne Classics, and PSP Minis updated monthlyExclusive discountsExclusive Themes, Avatars, and Add-On ContentEarly demos and beta testsSubscription to Qore, a PlayStation focused video seriesThe option to have the PS3 turn on at a specified time, daily, to search for and automatically updateCloud backup of saves (added in Firmware 3.60)\n\nAll free content is determined by Sony, and only available for the month chosen. Users can only access their free games while subscribed under PlayStation Plus, though the ability to play will renew itself as soon as a new subscription is bought. More features may be implemented in the future. Subscription plans are available for $17.99 for three months or $49.99 for fifteen months.\n\nNon-Plus users still have access to all previous features on PSN.\n\nThe 2011 PlayStation Network Security Breach\n\nOn April 20, 2011 Sony took down the PlayStation Network worldwide without any prior or post notice to consumers. This was later revealed to be in response to a report Sony had recived of a possible security breach that occured between April 17 and April 19, 2011. It was not until 6 days later on April 26, 2011 that Patrick Seybold, Senior Director of Corporate Communications and Social Media for SCEA, announced via the PlayStation Blog that personal information for the entire user base, totalling near 77 million users at the time, had been obtained by an unknown third party. It was confirmed by Sony on May 2, 2011 that credit card details for 10 million users were exposed.\n\nThe confirmed compromised information was as follows:\n\nnameaddress (city, state, zip)countrycredit card details (which was later revealed to have been further encrypted and therefore inaccessible even after being stolen)email addressbirth datePlayStation Network/Qriocity password and loginPSN online ID\n\nThe Welcome Back Program:\n\nSony detailed their \"Welcome Back\" plan for the users of PSN, a compensation pack for the inconvenience. The pack will give everyone signed up for PSN 30 days free of their premium subscription service Playstation Plus, with all members already signed up to the service receiving an extra 30 days to their subscription. Qriocity members will also receive an extra 30 days to their memberships.\n\nOn May 16, 2011 Sony added more details to the welcome back program. This program will be available to all members with an active PSN account previous to the shut down. The program will be available for 30 days shortly after the PSN store is restored.\n\nUS:\n\nAll PlayStation Network customers can select two PS3 games from the following list. The games will be available for 30 days shortly after PlayStation Store is restored and can be kept forever.\n\nDead NationinFAMOUSLittleBigPlanetSuper Stardust HDWipeout HD + Fury\n\nFor PSP owners, you will be eligible to download two PSP games from the following list.

                "description": "Overview\n\nIn terms of home video games, the PC is the oldest gaming platform still in use today, having an established library of tens of thousands of games. Chances are, you're probably reading this wiki on a PC right now. While there were various different personal computer platforms in the past (from manufacturers like NEC, Apple, Hitachi, Fujitsu, Commodore, Sharp, and Microsoft), the modern PC is largely descended from the IBM PC, which originally released in 1981 for $1561 (nearly $4000 in 2013 dollars).\n\nHistory\n\n￼An old IBM PC.\n\nThe first electronic computers were created between the 1930s and the 1940s. The first binary computer was the Z1 Computer, created by the German inventor Konrad Zuse. Other electronic computers would be created throughout the time period, including the ENIAC and the Harvard Mark I. Many of the first computers were used during World War II by both factions and would be later used for scientific research. Early computers were large enough to fill a room, making them unusable for practical, personal use. Later it would be used by banks and large businesses for economic calculations. Companies like IBM have supplied many businesses with computers years before the personal computer .\n\n1970s\n\nIt wasn't until the 1970s where computers usable for the average person were being made. Invented in 1970 by John V. Blakenbaker of the Kenbak Corporation, the Kenbak-1 is considered by the Computer History Museum to be the world's \"first personal computer\". Starting in 1971, it was sold for $750 and only 40 machines were ever built and sold. In 1973, Kenbak folded and stopped production. However, it was based on TTL (transistor-transistor-logic) discrete circuitry (much like the Magnavox Odyssey and Pong) rather than microprocessor technology. As such, it wasn't until the late 1970s that the first \"true\" personal computers began appearing.\n\nSeveral revolutionary inventions would later pave the way to the modern personal computer, most importantly the microprocessor. The project originated in 1969, when Japanese calculator manufacturer Busicom proposed the idea to American manufacturer Intel, and both soon collaborated to produce the first microprocessor. By 1971, Intel's engineers Bob Noyce and Gordon Moore, and Busicom's engineer Masatoshi Shima, succeeded in creating the world's first microprocessor, the 4-bit Intel 4004. The microprocessor helped in creating a more powerful central processing unit than the ones used in computers at the time and shrunk it so computers could be smaller. The microprocessor was the major invention that gave birth to the microcomputer, or the personal computer as it is known today.\n\nThe first microprocessor-based personal computer, i.e. the first microcomputer, was the SMP80/X, released by Sord (now Toshiba Personal Computer System Corporation) in 1974, utilizing the 8-bit Intel 8080 processor (its unreleased 1972 predecessor, the SMP80/08, used the first general-purpose microprocessor, the 8-bit Intel 8008). It was soon followed in 1975 by the Altair 8800, which also used the Intel 8080 as its CPU; since the computer's main language was binary code and only had an output of flashing lights, the computer was unusable by the common person. A similar microcomputer was released by NEC in 1976, the TK-80, which used the Intel 8080A.\n\nIt wasn't until 1977 when two California college students, Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak, created the first personal computer with a monitor, the Apple I. Thanks to the monitor, programming became much easier and programmers could see exactly what they were doing. Also, it helped the average user see the programs people created. This sparked a new revolution in the computer industry, bringing the creation of Apple Computers and starting the personal computer market. Other competing desktop computers with CRT display monitors soon followed in the late 1970s, including the M200 by Sord (now Toshiba Personal Computer System Corporation) in 1977, Hitachi's Basic Master in 1978, and Acorn's System 1 in 1979.\n\n1980s\n\n￼Powerful laptops have made PC gaming mobile.\n\nAfter the release of the Apple II, many competitors formed in the early 1980s, including the IBM Personal Computer, which would later dominate the market in the 1990s. The IBM PC was also one of the first 16-bit home computers, along with Mitsubishi's MULTI16 in 1981. Other leading competitors in the 1980s included Commodore, Atari and Amiga in Western markets, and NEC, Sharp and Fujitsu in Eastern markets. Due to the gaming crash of 1983, many computer manufacturers focused on the business aspects of these machines, leaving gaming as an afterthought.\n\nHowever, there were many computers that were well-known for their gaming libraries. The leading 8-bit gaming computer platforms in the 1980s included the Apple II in North America, the Commodore 64 and Atari 400/800 in the West, the ZX Spectrum and BBC Micro in the UK, the MSX in Japan and Europe, the high-resolution NEC PC-88 in Japan, and the high-colour FM-7 and Sharp X1 in Japan. The leading 16/32-bit gaming computers in the late 1980s to early 1990s were the NEC PC-98 in Japan, the Amiga and Atari ST in the West, the MS-DOS Compatible computers worldwide, and the more powerful (near arcade quality) Sharp X68000 and FM Towns computers in Japan. The best-selling computer models of the 20th century were the Commodore 64 (17 million units sold worldwide) and NEC PC-98 (over 18 million units sold in Japan). By the 1990s, companies like Origin Systems and EA became leading PC game developers.\n\nIn the mid-1980s, the graphical user interface was implemented on new PCs. Now it was easier for people to see what they were doing with computers thanks to computers like the Macintosh and the DOS extension Windows. The GUI was first created by Xerox in the 1960s, but the company was not interested in entering the computer market. Apple was given the rights to use GUI for the Macintosh, however, Microsoft was able to trick Apple into lending them prototype Macintosh computers to create programs for the new machines. They used the coding of the operating system to create Windows, an extension to DOS. Thanks to the cheap $100 price point and its compatibility with all DOS computers, Windows became a success, becoming the new standard of computers by the mid-1990s.\n\nThe 1980s also saw the emergence of portable laptop computers. The world's first laptop computer was the Epson HX-20 in 1981. The first commercially successful laptop was Kyocera's Kyotronic 85, originally released in 1983 and re-branded by Tandy as the TRS-80 Model 100, selling 6 million units worldwide. Other competitors soon followed, including Sharp's PC-5000 which had a touchpad pointing device in 1983, and Commodore's SX 64 in 1984. The first mass-market laptop was Toshiba's 16-bit T-1100 in 1985, which they followed with the T-3100 (the first with a built-in hard drive) in 1986. Other competitors soon followed, including NEC's PC-98 LT and IBM's PC Convertible in 1986 and Apple's Macintosh Portable in 1989. The first notebook computer was released in 1989, NEC's UltraLite, which they followed with the first colour TFT LCD laptop in 1990, the 32-bit PC-9801 NC. Apple soon followed with the PowerBook series from 1991 onwards, further popularizing laptop computers in the 1990s.\n\n1990s\n\nIn the 1990s, the Internet was released to the public after originally being used to connect college computers and military computers to different networks. Since the Internet was introduced to the public, it became a major part of modern society. Now the average computer user is able to access files from many different servers, and have the ability to communicate with people from around the world. This new technology was a revolution in gaming, with online gaming becoming a standard on the PC by the mid 1990s.\n\nAnother important revolution for PC gaming was the introduction of 3D graphics accelerator cards in the late 1990s, which allowed the PC to take the lead in cutting-edge 3D graphics technology by the 21st century. The first 3D graphics card for a home computer was NEC's PC-FXGA, released for their PC-98 platform in 1995, which could produce 3D graphics surpassing the PlayStation console and rivaling the Nintendo 64 in terms of polygon rendering performance. The first 3D graphics cards for IBM-compatible PC's soon followed in early 1996: Creative Labs' 3D Blaster, NVIDIA's NV1, and particularly NEC's PowerVR. While the 3D Blaster and NV1 (with the first game to support them being PlayStation port Toshinden) were unable to rival the PlayStation, the PowerVR surpassed the PlayStation and even approached arcade quality graphics, with a near arcade quality PowerVR demo of Namco's Rave Racer (though this PC port was later cancelled). Similarly, the NV1 card received PC ports of Sega titles Virtua Fighter Remix and Virtua Cop (which surpassed the Saturn versions, but couldn't rival the arcade originals). In late 1996, 3dfx launched the Voodoo line, which rivalled the PowerVR in quality and would soon become the most popular PC graphics cards of the late 1990s. Fujitsu soon introduced the FXG-1 \"Pinolite\" geometry processor, the first GPU with T&L (Transform & Lighting) hardware capabilities, in 1997, paving the way for NVIDIA's GeForce and ATI's Radeon, both of which would later dominate the PC graphics card market in the 21st century.\n\n21st century\n\nToday, more than a billion people around the world use the PC platform, with the majority of them being connected to the internet. A majority of PC gamers today are located in Asia, with China alone accounting for nearly a third of the worldwide PC gaming market, the growth of which has largely been fueled by the rise of online gaming.\n\nOperating Systems\n\nBefore operating systems, one had to learn complex coding in order to get something to work. With the creation of operating systems, computers became more accessible to the public.\n\nMicrosoft Windows\n\n￼￼Almost all PC games are designed for MS Windows.\n\nWindows was originally an extension to Microsoft's own coding system MS-DOS back in 1985. With Windows, people could easily browse through their files and do other simple functions much more quickly. Windows has grown in popularity and became the most popular OS in the world, having the support of PC makers like Dell, Gateway, and HP. Windows has gone through many iterations, starting with the MS-DOS days having Windows versions 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 3.1, and 3.11. Then came Windows NT 3.0-4.0 and Windows 2000 (oriented toward business) and the Windows 9x operating systems including Windows 95, 98, and ME (oriented toward home users). The 9x line was dropped and later versions of Windows have been based on NT, continuing the line from 2000 through XP, Vista, Windows 7, and now Windows 8.\n\nThe preferred platform for modern PC games is a Windows PC running either Windows XP, Vista, 7, or 8(.1). Windows XP does not support DirectX 10 but does not suffer from incompatibilities with older games like Vista, 7, or 8 may. Vista and 7 have the advantage of DirectX 10 or 11 while Windows 8.1 can support up to DirectX 11.2, and some exclusive games tied to the OS such as Halo 2. Because of the negative feedback that came from Vista, game developers were reluctant to make DirectX 10 only games. Thanks to the success of Windows 7, more DirectX 10/11 only games are being made, most notably Shattered Horizon, Just Cause 2, and Battlefield 3.\n\nWindows 7 provides gamers with a games browser that notifies the user of patches and updates for some games as they become available. Windows 7 is generally faster than Vista and fixes many of the issues people had with that OS such as intrusive Security settings and sluggish performance, Windows 7 also comes with DirectX 11. Dirt2 was among the first games to support this.\n\nOn October 25, 2012, Microsoft released Windows 8 to the public. This new operating system introduces the \"Metro\" interface, which makes menus more easily accessible to people who are using tablets and touch controls. Windows 8 also introduces its own app store which will allow developers to publish and distribute their Metro applications and games. Xbox Live is integrated with the OS which can be used as a user account for the computer and can earn achievement points on games downloaded from the app store. There have been complaints about the new OS because of its lackluster desktop interface and the removal of the standard Start menu in favor of the Metro interface, but Windows 8.1 addressed some of these issues with the return of the Start menu and the ability to use windowed Metro apps.\n\nOn July 29, 2015, Microsoft released Windows 10 to the public. It's a free update for all Windows 7 and 8 users for the first year of release, making it the first Windows OS that is available for free. One of the major features of Windows 10 is it's cross compatibility with tablets and smartphones as well as desktop and laptop PCs, as well as being implemented for Xbox One consoles in the future. It also features a new voice companion called Cortana, which is meant to compete with Apple's Siri. For gaming, Windows 10 introduces DirectX 12, which allows programmers to get better performance out of older graphics hardware with less oversight. Although current graphics cards can support some of the features of DirectX 12, fully-featured DX12 cards are not expected to release until 2016. The first game to support DX12 will be Fable Legends, which is releasing as a free-to-play title by the end of 2015. It also introduces further connections with the Xbox brand, where Microsoft will be selling games with the Xbox brand on the App Store as well as allow you to stream games from the Xbox One on all Windows 10 devices.\n\nMac OS\n\n￼￼Apple's Mac OS has a limited but growing game library.\n\nIn 1977, Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs made the Apple 1, Apple's first computer. They later gained popularity with the Apple II. In 1984, Apple released the Macintosh, which was the first Apple computer to have an operating system. The Mac OS lineup was born. Later, Apple switched to Unix-like coding, creating the Mac OS X lineup, which is still used in the new Apple computer lineup today.\n\nThe main issue with gaming on a Mac OS is that almost all earlier Mac PCs were not compatible with Windows based video games. More recently however with the creation of applications such as Boot Camp and Parallels more games are able to be run. The development of Intel based Macs also helps reduce this barrier by lifting some of the hardware restrictions.\n\nIn May 2010, Valve released Steam for Mac OS X, and ported all of their Source games to the Mac platform by the end of 2010. Valve is hoping for the expansion of Mac gaming in the near future.\n\nDuring the WDCC in 2014, Apple has announced their own graphics API, Metal. It allows game developers to use more hardware resources from devices using Mac OS X or iOS to gain better performance. This allows devices such as Macbooks and the iPad to run games with comparable performance to Windows PCs and consoles. Because of Metal, it was announced that Frostbite 3 is coming to Mac OS X and iOS, with its flagship title being Plants vs. Zombies: Garden Warfare.\n\nLinux\n\nLinux is a Unix-like OS licenced under the GPL. Unlike Windows and Mac OS, which require specific hardware for the OS to work properly, Linux is a software-based OS, which can be installed on a variety of devices, including devices which are not PC-based. Linux comes in various distributions, or \"distros,\" such as Ubuntu or Gentoo. Being an open source OS, the Linux community actively develops open source software, including games, for the Linux platform. However, there is no requirement that Linux software be open-source. You can get many Windows applications to work on Linux using specific Windows coding software for Linux (such as WINE) but it is generally not a preferable way of playing Windows games compared to running them in Windows on the same machine. Furthermore, WINE is not compatible with PowerPCs including PS3s with Linux installed. A popular option for overcoming Windows compatibility issues is to multi-boot the Linux distro with a version of Windows so that both operating systems are installed on the same PC at once and the user can switch between them.\n\nThere has been increased development for Linux games in recent years, with many indie games, such as Minecraft, releasing a Linux version. The Humble Indie Bundle typically includes Linux versions of games in addition to Mac and PC. Valve released the beta of their popular Steam platform for Linux (Starting with Ubuntu) in Nov. 2012 after their founder Gabe Newell expressed support for the platform. In 2013, Valve announced that they will be releasing their own Linux distro called SteamOS, which will be installed in all \"Steam Boxes\". It is a derivative of Ubuntu that has an interface similar to Big Picture Mode that can be navigated using a controller. It allows users to stream games from another PC so users can run games that are currently not compatible with Linux. However, support for Linux gaming has been growing over the years, with many games, including indie and AAA titles, having Linux versions being released at launch.\n\nThe most popular Linux-based OS on the market right now is Android. It is a growing, open source mobile operating system with a growing gaming library. However, it is important to note that most Linux-PC applications are incompatible with Android and vice-verse (without a significant amount of effort).\n\nComponents of a PC\n\nThere are many replaceable parts in a PC, which is a main aspect separating them from consoles. PCs may be upgraded and maintained as time passes to keep up with the latest games, and a user's configuration will affect which games they can play. The main parts of a computer are as follows:\n\nCPU (Central Processing Unit) - The processing unit that executes operations in a computer. It consists of an integrated circuit built of many transistors that runs on binary code. The CPU communicates with the rest of the computer through the Northbridge via a front side bus. Most medium and high end processors are 64-bit and have several cores which is known as parallel processing. The CPU creates a lot of heat and as a result requires its own dedicated heatsink or waterblock even on a low end computer.GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) - The dedicated graphics rendering device, very important for games. The GPU generally has its own circuit board which is slotted into the motherboard, the processing unit its self is also made up of many transistors and is heavily based on parallel processing. The GPU also uses its own dedicated RAM for storing texture data to be processed. Current generation GPUs are capable of rendering shader model 4.1 processes as part of the DirectX 11 package. Many graphics cards are also compatible with OpenGL.Motherboard - The main circuit board in a PC that all the components connect to. Its through this board that all other components may communicate between each other and is run by a set of North and South bridge chipsets, though newer CPUs actually include an integrated nothrbridge.RAM (Random Access Memory) - Volatile dynamic memory of a system. Data can be temporarily loaded here to be accessed much faster than from the hard drive or even a solid state drive so not to slow the calculations made by the CPU. The current standard is DDR3.PSU (Power Supply Unit) - Supplies power to the PC. Needs to have high enough power (measured in Watts) to run all the components in the system under high load.HDD (Hard Disk Drive) - The main storage device of a PC.SSD (Solid State Drive) - A type of storage similar to a hard drive, but contain no moving parts. Because of this, data stored in solid state drives can be accessed and written quicker than hard drives.Sound Card - An expansion card that processes audio on a separate chip. Most motherboards provide integrated sound chips making sound cards an optional upgrade.ODD (Optical Disc Drive) - The peripheral device that reads optical discs such as DVDs, BDs, and CDs.Case - Houses the components.Monitor - The visual display unit of a computer.Input Devices - Mouse, keyboard, microphone, etc. Because of the uptake of the Xbox 360 most games from 2005 onward will work with the Xbox 360 controller. This is also helped by the fact that the Xbox 360 has a USB connection that allows game developers to easily port the control system from current console games to the PC. In 2014, Microsoft released drivers that allowed Xbox One controllers to work for all 360 controller-compatible games.Cooling - Commonly either water or air based. With standard cooling devices the lowest possible temperature is the ambient temperature, that of the room the system resides in. To further lower the temperature elaborate devices such as Peltier coolers, liquid gases or phase cooling may be installed, though this is best left to the extreme enthusiast due to the risk of most of these options.\n\nGraphic Settings\n\nUnlike their console equivalents most PC games have the ability to vary the graphical settings. This feature is inherent to PCs as few systems bear the same hardware and so the user must tailor the game's settings for optimal performance and visual quality. With modern hardware PCs can often surpass their console counterparts in terms of technical graphics. Recent titles offer the option to set the ideal configuration of a game automatically. Such settings include:\n\nResolution - The number of pixels along the x and y axes to which the game will render.Anti-Aliasing - Raises the quality of the edges of polygon based models using smoothing algorithms.Anisotropic Filtering - Raises the quality of textures viewed from obtuse angles.Texture Quality - General resolution of the paint scheme of each model.Model Quality - General number of polygons used for each model.High Dynamic Range lighting - Allows for dynamic tone mapping in games.Shader Model - Technology a game can use to render advanced visual effects.Vsync - Reduces an artifact known as tearing by synchronizing the frame rate and refresh rate of the monitor.\n\nGame Lineup\n\nEarly History\n\n￼￼Blizzard is one of the most prominent PC developers.\n\nComputers first featured simple titles similar to SpaceWar! or simple text-input games such as Adventure but have since evolved to become the leading platform for cutting-edge game development in the 21st century due to their seemingly limitless potential.\n\nOld computers such as the Commodore 64 and NEC PC-98 featured a built-in controller port, for C64 controllers as well as Atari 2600 and other controllers. Many games supported both keyboard and joystick input. Since mice have become standard, they have become the preferable method of input for many games, with various manufacturers branding mice specifically for gaming. Joysticks are still widely used via USB. Early games were simply saved onto floppy disks by a publisher or even the programmer themselves. These disks were sold in Ziploc bags and Vinyl slips; they generally had a bland manual and had nowhere near the shelf-presentation of a modern game. Modern games are distributed mainly on optical discs in hard plastic cases or cardboard boxes. There has been a large surge in digital distribution as well.\n\nEvolution in the 1990s\n\nIn the early days of computer gaming, most games were developed by a single programmer, and were often simple text adventures or downgraded ports/clones of more powerful arcade games. PC gaming has since evolved to encompass a wide variety of genres, some faring better than others.\n\nThe most popular genres that have evolved on the platform are the CRPG (Computer Role-Playing Game), RTS (Real-Time Strategy), and FPS (First-Person Shooter).\n\nCRPG's were largely inspired by pen & paper role playing games such as Dungeons & Dragons. The genre spans early ASCII adventures such as Rogue, action RPG's such as Dragon Slayer and Diablo, and MMORPGs (Massively Multiplayer Online RPGs) such as Lineage and World of Warcraft. Freedom is a main element that has evolved with CRPG's. The earlier games were more linear in their approach, sometimes even approaching level design from a distinct \"stages\" standpoint. CRPGs evolved to have 3D dungeons, real time combat, and huge multiplayer, non-linear worlds.\n\nReal-Time Strategy games, such as Starcraft and Command & Conquer, is a genre that was at the heart of PC gaming in the 1990s and continues to remain a dominant PC genre in Asian countries like South Korea and China. The genre requires fast-paced clicking using a mouse, making implementation on consoles very difficult; ironically, the game often considered the first RTS, Herzog Zwei, was a Sega Mega Drive / Genesis console game. The genre has certainly seen evolution, but the premise of collecting resources, spawning an army, and sending it into battle, has remained relatively constant throughout RTS history. Today, the most popular RTS games are called MOBAs (Multiplayer Online Battle Arenas), with games such as League of Legends and DOTA 2 being some of the most played games in the world.\n\n￼￼Steam comprises over 70% of the digital distribution market.\n\nThe third, and arguably most popular, PC genre is the FPS. After being popularized with iD Software's Wolfenstein 3D, the genre exploded into popularity with Doom. The use of mouse a mouse to look around was later popularized by Duke Nukem 3D and Quake. It's a genre that has been ported to consoles, but still controls better on PC due to quick, precise aiming with mice. Landmark PC FPS games include Doom, Quake, Counter-Strike, and Half-Life.\n\nThe PC game industry has seen a steady push towards consoles for many years now, due to low sales numbers. These sales are often attributed to illegal downloading as well as the cost of upgrading one's system. The PC industry is largely kept alive by the convenience of having many games at ones fingertips on a PC as well as the superiority of certain genres on the platform.\n\nHowever, PC gaming has seen a massive resurgence of popularity within the last few years thanks to the growing popularity of Steam, the massive success of indie titles such as Minecraft and DayZ, and the rise of eSports with games such as League of Legends, DOTA 2, and Counter Strike: Global Offensive.\n\nDigital Distribution\n\nHowever, even with retail PC game sales slowing, digital distribution has been expanding within the last few years. Popular digital distribution services like Valve's Steam, EA's Origin, and Desura helped in boosting the sales of PC games and have helped in making many indie games popular. Other digital distributors, like GOG, sell older PC games that either don't sell in retail anymore or are too old to be compatible with newer operating systems. These services allow you to play older games and usually sell them for less than $10 while also being free of DRM. The Humble Indie Bundle and other alternatives have been a great resource in downloading numerous indie and retail games for prices set by the end user. The majority of the proceeds go to the game developers as well as numerous charities. These type of services help in having an easy way to play PC games and having developers keep in touch with their communities.\n\nIssues\n\nUpgrading\n\n￼￼NVidia's popular GeForce series of GPUs.\n\nA primary issue with PC gaming is the barrier to entry due to cost. Pricing of a PC depends on what type of performance a user wants when it comes to playing games, but for people who want to play games at maximum settings, it can cost at least $1000 to build and up to $3000 to buy from a manufacturer. In order to play some of the biggest, most graphically impressive games on PC at maximum settings with a stable framerate, it may require a user to upgrade their computer components every 2-3 years. However, thanks to better optimization of games and the creation of lower level APIs such as AMD's Mantle, the barrier of entry for PC gaming has been decreasing and lower-end hardware can be used to run games with decent performance.\n\nThe ability to selectively upgrade hardware also gives PC gamers a flexibility absent in console gaming. Users can upgrade RAM, GPU or hard drives to make their computers more powerful as the games become more demanding. In turn, this flexibility and constant increase in performance allows developers to create games that can fully utilize the latest hardware, often leading to more complex or better looking games.\n\nPiracy and Digital Rights Management\n\nOne huge problem reported by publishers with PC gaming is the excessive piracy of games. Bootleg copies of games have been a problem since the introduction of the personal computer. Many computer experts were able to copy floppy disks and distribute them to either share with friends or profit off them. Since the introduction of the internet, it has been easier to distribute pirated software than ever before (including games). Bittorrent sites make it easier for people to put up game files where everyone can download and play.\n\nAlthough piracy ranges across the world, the areas with the most piracy are developing nations. These are areas that either have poor game distribution or have gamers that are too poor to afford many games. Piracy has also gone up since the economic crash of 2008.\n\nThere are many measures that game publishers use in attempts to prevent piracy. Floppy disk games of the 1980's included items in their game boxes called \"feelies\", or items necessary to have in order to play the game. Some games required the player to look in the instruction manual and type in a specific word to play the game while others had the player decrypt a code displayed on a screen using one of the items in the box. As CD games became more popular and CD copiers were gaining traction, CD keys, unique codes to identify legitimately purchased games, were introduced. Sometimes CD keys are used to access certain parts of a game such as multiplayer and Live features in Games for Windows Live games. There have been many issues with CD keys. If you were to lose your CD key and needed to reinstall a game, you had to buy your game again. This type of security did not last long because pirates were finding ways to create fake CD keys that they could use to play pirated games. Digital Distribution has made CD keys mostly obsolete.\n\nThis led game publishers and various third parties to develop forms of Digital Rights Management (DRM). DRM is digtal software protection that prevents the user from using copied game discs and downloaded disc images or installing games on multiple machines. Some early forms of DRM may interfere with some applications such as disc drive emulation software used for mounting disc images.\n\n￼￼Activation failure screen for GTA IV.\n\nThere have been controversial uses of DRM within the last few years. In 2008, EA announced that they are going to use a new version of SecuROM DRM that limits the number of simultaneous activated installs for all of their new PC games (starting with Mass Effect and Spore). Since then there has been a huge controversy over DRM, even questioning the legality of it.\n\nIn 2009, Ubisoft introduced a new DRM that will require you to be online at all times when playing a game. If you are disconnected from the internet for any reason, gameplay will stop. The first games to utilize the new DRM were Assassin's Creed II and Silent Hunter 5. As of 2011, Ubisoft decided to discontinue and retool their online DRM system with the release of Assassin's Creed Brotherhood, and was relaunched with the release of Driver: San Francisco. Today, Ubisoft has their own digital platform, Uplay, that is needed to access many of their games.\n\nCommon complaints about this type of DRM are losing game progress and not being able to play when an internet connection is unavailable. Other companies are using similar DRM including EA with Command and Conquer 4 and Blizzard with StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty and Diablo III. Both C&C4 and D3 require a constant, active connection to the host servers, but Blizzard's implementation in SC2 allows offline play of the single player campaign and AI versus modes with achievement functionality disabled.\n\nMany digital distributors feature their own DRM. Steam requires users to connect to their servers at least once and enable offline mode before playing games offline. In Steam's offline mode, achievements are deactivated. Microsoft's Games For Windows Live has similar restrictions.\n\n",

                "description": "Overview\n\n￼PSP revisions from top to bottom: The 1000, 2000, 3000, and Go models.\n\nThe PlayStation Portable (or PSP) was released March 24, 2005 and marked Sony's first entry into the handheld gaming market.\n\nIn late 2007, the PSP was upgraded with a new hardware variation known by the model number PSP-2000.\n\nOn August 20, 2008, at the Leipzig Games Convention, Sony announced a new revision of the PSP, the PSP-3000.\n\nOn June 2, 2009, at E3 in Los Angeles, Sony announced the PSPgo, which removed the UMD drive and instead was the first dedicated gaming handheld to be completely dependent on downloaded software.\n\nIn August, 2011, at Gamescom in Cologne, Sony announced the budget priced PSP-E1000 for PAL regions, which retained a UMD drive but removed network support. This would be the last revision of the PSP.\n\nPSP-2000 (PSP Slim)\n\n￼PSP 1000 (bottom) vs. Slim (top)\n\nDuring the E3 conference of 2007, Sony released several details about the PSP's first hardware revision. The model number is PSP-2000, then commonly referred to as the PSP Slim. The Slim replaced the original (or ''phat'') PSP on the market and had significant hardware changes. The amount of RAM in the PSP-2000 was doubled from 32 megabytes to 64 megabytes. This added RAM was primarily used to decrease UMD load times, and to improve the memory limit when browsing web pages. The Slim's battery was manufactured to supply the same amount of playtime as the Phat battery while attaining a smaller form factor. The WLAN switch was relocated to the top of the device, and the UMD drive now required the user to open it manually, as opposed to the spring-loaded version in the PSP-1000 that was activated using a switch.\n\nThe PSP Slim was released in September of 2007.\n\nPSP-3000 (PSP Brite)\n\n￼￼PSP Slim vs. PSP-3000\n\nSony officially announced the PSP-3000 at the 2008 Leipzig Games Convention. Improvements over the PSP-2000 included a built in mic and an improved LCD screen. The new screen features twice the color gamut, five times the contrast ratio, and a response time that is twice as fast as the PSP-2000's LCD screen. It also features a new anti-reflective technology for improved viewing of the LCD screen in outdoor areas.\n\nThe PSP-3000 was released in Japan, Europe and North America in October.\n\nPSPgo\n\n￼￼PSP GO in the Flesh\n\nDuring E3 2009, Sony revealed the PSPgo, (or PSP Go) the lightest and most physically compact PSP model. This portability is achieved using a slide-out form factor, a smaller screen (3.8 inch screen as opposed to the 4.3 inches on all other models), and the removal of the UMD drive, limiting the system to digitally downloaded games only. Under the hood, PSPgo is identical to other PSP models, with the same capabilities and OS, while also adding 16GB internal flash memory and PS3 controller support . However, the lack of UMD drive, which physically prevents it from playing disc-based games, resulted in the PSP Go being a complete commercial failure.\n\nThe 16GB internal storage space can be expanded by the use of Sony's proprietary M2 Memory Stick, unlike the other models of PSP, which use the Memory Stick ProDUO. The PSPgo existed alongside the PSP-3000 when it launched on October 1st, 2009, and unlike other PSP revisions was not intended by Sony to be a replacement for existing models.\n\nThe device proved unpopular with many gamers for various reasons, most notably the fact that PSP game discs could not be played on the PSPgo. Even if you own a game on disc, in order to play it you would have to repurchase and download the game from PSN, often at a marked up price. To make matters worse, certain PSP titles were never made available for digital download at all, making the PSPgo unattractive even to gamers who did not yet own a PSP.\n\nOther issues include the fact that PSN games tend to be overpriced, the slow download speeds on PSP systems in general, new games being listed incorrectly in PSN store, the fact that some games suffering from glitches not found in their UMD counterparts, and poor customer service.\n\nPSP-E1000\n\n￼￼PSP-E1000\n\nAnnounced at Gamescom 2011, the PSP-E1000 is a budget-priced PSP available only in PAL territories. Reversing course from the PSPgo, the PSP-E1000 includes a UMD drive, but does not include any network capabilities whatsoever. Slightly larger and heavier than the PSP-3000, the PSP-E1000 has a charcoal black plastic matte body similar to the slim PS3 redesign. The layout is fairly similar to the original PSP, however it moves the system buttons to a single row below the screen which is flush with the case itself. To save on costs, the PSP-E1000 removed WiFi and has only one speaker instead of two. Despite the lack of wireless connectivity, PSN content could still be accessed by connecting the PSP-E1000 to a Playstation 3, or to a PC via USB and using Sony's Media Go software.\n\nThe PSP-E100 launched at a cost of â‚¬99.99 or Â£85.\n\nReception\n\nShown off at E3 2004, the portable was highly anticipated and thought of by many at the time to be superior to the Nintendo DS which was launching around the same time.\n\nHowever, leadIng up to launch whispers of long load times and a short battery life began appearing online. These criticisms were true and it was something that would haunt the system for a majority of it's life.\n\nAnother hamper to the system was a divided perspective of the handheld market. During its first few years, the PSP would often get ports or sequels of console games that many felt were ill-suited for the portable market. By 2006 and continuing into 2007, several of these PSP titles were ported to Playstation 2.\n\nRampant piracy was also an issue for third parties. The PSP was easily hackable and guides on how to bypass the system's security were easily available on the web. Sony attempted through several firmware updates to make hacking the system more difficult but the wheels were already in motion.\n\nBy mid-2008 the once promising handheld's library looked barren with few games being released apart from ports. Sony would try in 2009 to give the system one last serious push with titles like Rockband Unplugged and Motorstorm Arctic Edge but at that point much of the damage had already been done.\n\nDespite this the PSP is still remembered for its best games and for being the most successful dedicated gaming handheld that wasn't made by Nintendo. The system is also known among gamers for its homebrew scene which Sony desperately tried to put a lid on.\n\nIn Japan, the PSP continued to be phenomenally successful well past the launch date of the Playstation Vita, (the PSP's successor) and even outselling the Nintendo DS and 3DS for a period of time.\n\nLaunch Titles\n\nJapanese launch titles\n\nArmored Core: Formula FrontMahjong FightMinna no Golf PortableLuminesRidge RacersVampire Chronicle: The Chaos Tower\n\nNorth American Launch Titles\n\nApe Escape: On the LooseDarkstalkers Chronicle: The Chaos TowerDynasty WarriorsGretzky NHLLuminesMetal Gear AcidNBANeed for Speed Underground: RivalsNFL Street 2 UnleashedRidge RacerSpider-Man 2Tiger Woods PGA TourTony Hawk's Underground 2 RemixTwisted Metal: Head-OnUntold Legends: Brotherhood of the BladeWipeout PureWorld Tour SoccerDead to Rights ReckoningMidnight Club 3: DUB EditionMVP BaseballSmart BombHot Shots Golf: Open TeeNBA Street ShowdownRengoku: Tower of PurgatoryFIFA SoccerATV Offroad Fury : Blazin' TrailsMLBMercury\n\nEuropean Launch Titles\n\nApe AcademyArcher Maclean's MercuryColin McRae Rally 2005Darkstalkers Chronicle: The Chaos TowerDynasty WarriorsEverybody's Golf PortableFired UpKao ChallengersLuminesMediEvil ResurrectionMetal Gear AcidMidnight Club 3: DUB EditionNeed for Speed Underground: RivalsRidge RacerSmart BombSpider-Man 2TOCA Race Driver 2Tony Hawks Underground 2 RemixUntold Legends: Brotherhood of the BladeVirtua Tennis: World TourWipeout PureWorld Snooker Championship 2005World Tour Soccer: Challenge EditionWorld Rally Championship\n\nUMD\n\n'Universal Media Discs' are used by the PSP for games and movies. They are small circular discs in a plastic casing. All PSP models except the PSPgo support this format, and various games include firmware updates for the PSP on their disc.\n\nSome movies available on UMD are now included on Blu-Ray releases. The user can download a PSP version of the film from their PS3 to the PSP or PSPgo. Some examples are Godzilla and The Ugly Truth.\n\nCopies of Lumines featured an older firmware update which many users bought and installed to unlock their PSP. At the time this firmware update left the PSP easier to unlock. More recent firmware updates make this harder to do.\n\nMedia Functionality\n\nThe PSP plays most MP3 and AVC music files. The PSP's video playback options are far more limited, however. The PSP can play movie downloads and rentals from the Playstation Video store, but playing your own movies generally requires a file converter as the PSP does not support the vast majority of movie files.\n\nVideos, games, and music can all be managed on the PSP by connecting it to your PC via a USB cable. Sony also distributes free software named Media Go, which allows users to download PSN content from their PC.\n\nEach PSP requires a Memory Stick Pro Duo, which is a proprietary memory stick format created by Sony. The memory stick is typically sold separately.\n\nCustom Firmware and Homebrew\n\nThe PSP was very well known for it's Custom Firmware scene. By opening up the battery and cutting a part of it, you could install Custom Firmware which allowed users to run unsigned software, which allowed ISOs of PSP games, emulators, and homebrew. It was later made even easier, because by some point you could just do it from files on the Memory Stick. Throughout the PSP's life, Sony tried to put a lid on this and kept updating the firmware, plugging up exploits each time, which made them infamous in the Homebrew scene. Now that the PSP has been discontinued, it's very easy to mod them, even on hardware revisions that were unmoddable during a good portion of their life, including the PSP go.\n\nSpecifications\n\nCPUMIPS R4000-based; clocked from 1 to 333 MHzStorage CapacityPSP1000/2000/3000: Memory Stick Duo and Memory Stick PRO Duo (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64 or 128 GB)\nPSPgo: Memory Stick M2Memory32 MB (1000 model) or 64 MB (2000, 3000, and PSP Go models)Display480 Ã— 272 pixels with 16.8 million colors, 16:9 widescreen TFT LCD, 3.8 in (97 mm) (PSP GO), 4.3 in (110 mm) (All other models)ConnectivityWi-Fi (802.11b),IrDA, USBDimensionsPSP1000: 74 mm (2.9 in) (h) 170 mm (6.7 in) (w) 23 mm (0.91 in) (d)\nPSP2000/3000: 71 mm (2.8 in) (h) 169 mm (6.7 in) (w) 19 mm (0.75 in) (d)\nPSPgo: 69 mm (2.7 in) (h) 128 mm (5.0 in) (w) 16.5 mm (0.65 in) (d)WeightPSP1000: 280 grams (9.9 oz)\nPSP2000/3000: 189 grams (6.7 oz)\nPSPgo: 158 grams (5.6 oz)",

                "description": "Overview\n\n￼The PlayStation 2\n\nThe PlayStation 2 was developed by Sony Interactive Entertainment and was released on March 4th 2000 in Japan, October 26th 2000 in North America, November 24th 2000 in Europe, and November 30th 2000 in Australia. The PlayStation 2 is powered by a 128-bit CPU that Sony co-developed with Toshiba, known as the \"Emotion Engine.\" It was also comprised of a \"Graphics Synthesizer\" chip (its GPU), a 24x speed CD-ROM (which was also a 4x DVD drive), 2 proprietary controller ports, 2 proprietary memory card slots, a DEV9 expansion bay for a network adapter, and 2 USB 1.1 ports.\n\nThe PS2 initially sold well, partly due to the strength of the PlayStation brand and the console's backward compatibility with original PlayStation titles. It sold over 980,000 units by March 5th 2000, or one day after launch in Japan.\n\nIts launch was not without setbacks. Manufacturing delays pushed back the original launch day of the PlayStation 2 to fall in North America. Also, a number of early PlayStation 2 units suffered from disk read errors, which subsequently prompted a class action lawsuit against Sony. Sony agreed to provide free repair services or replacement for the faulty consoles, and continued to do so until February 2005.\n\nAt the time, many people in the gaming industry predicted a close match up between the PlayStation 2, Microsoft's Xbox, and Nintendo's GameCube. Several blockbuster games were released for the PlayStation 2 during the 2001 holiday season, which helped maintain sales momentum and hold off its rivals. Sega's Dreamcast was released a full 16 months before the PlayStation 2, but failed to gain momentum. Sega discontinued the Dreamcast in March of 2001, in order to focus on publishing software. \n\nDiscontinuation\n\nOn December 28th, 2012, Sony confirmed that the PlayStation 2 console had been discontinued in Japan. A week later, Sony confirmed that manufacture of the console had been discontinued worldwide, marking almost 13 years of production for the console. At 150 million units sold worldwide, it is the best-selling console ever.\n\nLaunch Titles\n\nJapan - March 4, 2000\n\nA-Train 6DrumManiaEternal RingKakinoki Shogi IVKessenMorita ShogiRidge Racer VStepping SelectionStreet Fighter EX3\n\nNorth America - October 26, 2000\n\nArmored Core 2Dead or Alive 2: HardcoreDynasty Warriors 2ESPN International Track and FieldESPN X-Games SnowboardingEternal RingEvergraceFantavisionGungriffon BlazeKessenMadden NFL 2001Midnight ClubMoto GPNHL 2001OrphenQ-Ball Billiards MasterReady 2 Rumble Boxing Round 2Ridge Racer VSilent ScopeSmuggler's RunSSXStreet Fighter EX3SummonerSwing Away GolfTekken TAG TournamentTimeSplittersUnreal TournamentWild Wild RacingX-Squad\n\nEurope - November 24, 2000\n\nAqua AquaBust A Move 4Donald Duck Quack AttackESPN International Track and FieldESPN X-Games SnowboardingF1 Racing ChampionshipFantavisionFIFA 2001Gradius III & IVInternational Superstar Soccer 2000Madden NFL 2001Midnight ClubOrphenRayman RevolutionRC Revenge ProReady 2 Rumble Boxing Round 2Ridge Racer VSilent ScopeSmuggler's RunSSXSummonerSwing Away GolfTekken TAG TournamentTimeSplittersTheme Park WorldWild Wild RacingX-Squad\n\nOnline\n\nBefore the launch of Microsoft's online capable Xbox, Sony placed little emphasis on online gaming during the PlayStation 2's early years. In 2002, however, Sony began heavily advertising several online first-party titles, such as SOCOM: US Navy Seals. Although late, and despite the fact that Sony required developers to pick up the responsibility of providing servers, online gaming was one of the major selling points of the PlayStation 2. The original PlayStation 2 consoles did not have an integrated network adapter, requiring instead that the user purchase the unit separately. The launch of the PlayStation 2 Slim model saw the network adapter built into the console.\n\nPlayStation 2 Slim\n\n￼PS2 Slim\n\nIn September 2004, in time for the launch of Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, Sony unveiled one of its major hardware revisions: a smaller, thinner and quieter PlayStation 2 that included a built-in Ethernet port. Called the PS2 Slim, it did not contain a 3.5\" expansion bay, thus removing support for an internal hard disk drive. Similar to the GameCube, early models lacked an internal power supply, and had a modified multi-tap expansion. Later models of the PlayStation 2 Slim do not require an external power supply. The removal of the expansion bay was criticized as a limitation due to the existence of titles such as Final Fantasy XI, which required the use of the HDD. The PlayStation 2 Slim model was first released in black, however today the slimline model can be found in silver, white, and pink in North America.\n\nPSX\n\nThe Sony PSX (not to be confused with the PlayStation) is a consumer device that can be used as a digital video recorder, DVD burner, and PS2 game player. It also includes built in video, photo, and audio editing software. The device, which has only released in Japan, was poorly received, with some major features absent from the first editions of the hardware. Despite major price drops on the device, sales were very weak in Japan. It is still notable for introduction of the popular XMB interface, now used in Sony's PSP, PlayStation 3, and Bravia TVs.\n\nAccessories and Peripherals\n\nDualShock 2\n\n￼￼DualShock 2 The DualShock 2 is the standard controller which comes packaged with the PS2. Visually, it was practically identical to the original DualShock, with the main distinction being its black color. The controller included rumble and had the same button layout as its predecessor, but was lighter, had more accurate analog movement, and featured pressure sensitive buttons. The DualShock 2 is regarded as one of the best controllers ever made, despite some criticisms of parallel analog sticks, shallow buttons, and questionable ergonomics.\n\nEyeToy\n\n￼￼EyeToy Camera One of the most well known of all the PS2's peripherals is the EyeToy. It was a USB vision camera which took images of what the player was doing and relayed it back into games so the player could interact with games using motion. The camera was mainly used with the nine games of the EyeToy franchise but also with other games that used the device's capabilities, such as Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME, although the EyeToy isn't integral to the gameplay experience in most of these games. The camera has serious limitation; it has roughly 1.3 megapixels, and needed a lot of light in the playing area. A red LED turns on when EyeToy doesn't have enough light to distinguish the player from the background.\n\nPS2 HDD\n\n￼￼PS2 HDD Released in North America and Japan, the PlayStation 2 Hard Drive Disk allowed for the storage of up to 40GB. The HDD could be used to reduce load times by caching data on the hard drive. Few North American games had HDD support, and the only game which actually needed the drive was Final Fantasy XI, as it was used to store patches and other game updates. In 2004, the device stopped receiving support from Sony. The Slimline model can't use the HDD without a 3rd party cable.\n\nBest Selling Games\n\nGrand Theft Auto: San Andreas - 17.33 MillionGran Turismo 3: A-Spec - 14.89 MillionGran Turismo 4 - 10.76 MillionGrand Theft Auto: Vice City - 9.61 MillionGrand Theft Auto III - 7.9 MillionMetal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty - 7 MillionFinal Fantasy X - 6.6 MillionKingdom Hearts - 5.9 Million ShippedFinal Fantasy XII - 5.2 Million ShippedDragon Quest VIII: Journey of the Cursed King - 4.78 Million Shipped\n\nHardware Specifications\n\nGeneral\n\nCPU: 128 Bit \"Emotion Engine\"System Clock: 300 MHzSystem Memory: 32 MB Direct RambusMemory Bus Bandwidth: 3.2 GB per secondCo-Processor: FPU (Floating Point Multiply Accumulator x 1, Floating Point Divider x 1)Vector Units: VU0 and VU1 (Floating Point Multiply Accumulator x 9, Floating Point Divider x 1)Floating Point Performance: 6.2 GFLOPSCompressed Image Decoder: MPEG2\n\nAudio\n\nNumber of voices: ADPCM: 48 channel on SPU2 plus definable by softwareSampling Frequency: 44.1 KHz or 48 KHz (selectable)\n\nI/O\n\nCPU Core: Current PlayStation CPUClock Frequency: 33.8 MHz or 37.5 MHz (selectable)Sub Bus: 32 BitInterface Types: IEEE1394, Universal Serial Bus (USB)Communication: via PC-Card PCMCIADisc Media: DVD-ROM (CD-ROM compatible)\n\nGraphics\n\nClock Frequency: 150MHzDRAM Bus bandwidth: 48 GB Per SecondDRAM Bus width: 2560 bitsPixel Configuration: RGB:Alpha:Z Buffer (24:8:32)Maximum Polygon Rate: 75 Million Polygons Per Second (Theoretical Peak)3D CG Geometric Transformation: 66 million Polygons Per Second (Theoretical Peak)\n\n",

                "description": "Overview\n\n￼Jobs and Wozniak.\n\nThe \"Apple ][\" as it was initially branded was released in 1977 and was the follow-up effort to the Apple-1 which was born from the mind of one Steve Wozniak. Even before fully completing the Apple-1 though, Wozniak was already dreaming of bigger and better things. A major goal he set in creating his next machine--the Apple ][--was to have it display in color. As he worked with potential hardware changes he began to realize the potential of the Apple ][ more and more. His previous experience with the game Breakout on the Atari 2600 motivated Wozniak to essentially ensure the Apple ][ could be a great gaming machine. After Wozniak set up the new computer to display in color, he naturally continued on to add sound and then paddle control to the Apple ][. The Apple ][ was now a full blown gaming machine.\n\nThough the designs of the Apple-1 and later the Apple ][ were basically Steve Wozniak's efforts alone, Steve Jobs played a very important role in establishing the visual appearance of the Apple ][. While Wozniak wouldn't think twice about extra wires hanging about on a computer that worked, Jobs knew how to make an appealing package for people outside the once very niche computer enthusiast group. The Apple ][ was made to look quite different from other similar machines on the market. It had a much more user-friendly aesthetic. It almost looked like a typewriter but at the same time was \"futuristic\" enough to clearly be seen as a computer. The case was user-friendly as well. It was easily removable which was rare at the time. Most similar devices warned against any type of self-service and didn't welcome exploration.\n\nThe Apple ][ and Gaming\n\nSince Steve Wozniak designed the Apple ][ to be a gaming machine, it ended up being really successful as one. There were\n\n￼Mystery House.\n\ncountless games either designed specifically for the Apple ][ or ported over from arcade versions or other systems versions over the years. One of the most important games to come from the Apple ][ early on though was a game called Mystery House. This was the first adventure style game to feature graphics of any kind. all previous games of this style were purely text based. A worthwhile side note is that Mystery House was created by Ken and Roberta Williams who went on to start the company Sierra Entertainment, Inc. As previously mentioned, there were many ports of games that came to the Apple ][. Just a few of these titles include popular games such as:\n\nPaper BoyDig DugDonkey KongManiac MansionBad DudesA Mind Forever VoyagingAliens:The computer gameArkanoidArkanoid IIDynastyDepth ChargeF-15 Strike EagleImpossible MissionImpossible Mission IIPrince of PersiaStar Trek: The Kobayashi Alternative\n\nMost commercial software was provided on 5.25\" floppy diskettes, but the earliest and cheapest disk drives of the era could only read one side at a time. This resulted in larger games being shipped on multiple, more expensive double-sided diskettes, and because there was no hard drive to install the software on to it, prompts would appear instructing the user when to swap or flip the diskettes to continue.\n\nEven though the graphics were often pared down as the Apple ][ became older, it still provided Apple owners with roughly the same experience of these games. The Apple ][, along with machines like the Amiga, the Atari 400 and 800, and the Commodore 64 (to an extent), single-handedly drove the microcomputer gaming era beginning in the late 70s.\n\nHardware Details\n\nThe Apple ][ was a very versatile computer in terms of hardware and software. The Apple ][ was actually the leader as a platform for launching new and unique hardware gadgets for quite some time after its initial launch in 1977. The popularity of the Apple ][ series kept it on the cutting edge of hardware/peripheral development until about 1991. That's nearly 15 years of hardware development for a single platform. Standard hardware components were included the Apple ][, such as keyboard, RAM, CPU, etc. The first Apple ][ models were built and shipped with 4K of memory, upgradable via expansion ports up to 48K. The Apple ]['s various expansion ports proved very useful for the many possible hardware upgrades to come in the future.\n\nHardware expansions were very common despite not always being very compatible or universal. Some of the general \"upgrades\" one could purchase and install included:\n\nInterface CardsVideo CardsROM/RAM expansion cardsCo-ProcessorsAcceleratorsPrintersAlternate Input Devices (joysticks, paddles, etc.)\n\nThe earliest Apple ][ keyboards are notable for not having a CAPS LOCK key, because the system typeface included in ROM had no lower-case letters. Graphical fonts could be used by applications to overcome this limitation, as the keyboard did have a Shift function for typing symbols placed above the number row.\n\nThe Apple logo on the case was emblazoned with a rainbow of stripes to signify the system's ability to produce color. Display monitors sold with the Apple ][ were generally monochrome, commonly in green or amber. The video capabilities of the system, however, were based on the NTSC video standard. Hooking up a normal household television to the computer would allow for compatible games and applications to display in a small but variable color palette, depending on the video mode used and the technique of signal modulation.\n\nHardware Evolution and New Models\n\nApple ][ Plus\n\n￼￼The Apple II Plus\n\nThe Apple ][ Plus hardware was introduced to market in June 1979. Upgraded features included a ROM-integrated version of the Applesoft II BASIC programming language (supplied by Microsoft), and a much larger 48K bank of RAM now expandable to 64K.\n\nThe inclusion of the BASIC programming language in every model sold, rather than having to purchase it separately, provided a greater opportunity for every end user to explore programming and naturally game development on the system. Computer enthusiast magazines of this era would often include several pages of BASIC code that a user would painstakingly type in by hand, to run various utility or entertainment programs, some even including primitive graphics. In the event of an error in the printed code, a user could attempt debugging, or simply wait for the next magazine issue to print a correction.\n\n",

                "description": "Overview\n\nAfter seeing how successful the gaming market was, Microsoft decided it was time to produce a home console; The Xbox (which originally was going to be called the DirectX-box) was released in North America on November 15, 2001, Japan on February 22, and Europe and Australia on March 14, 2002.\n\nIt was the direct competitor of the Nintendo GameCube and the PlayStation 2. It was the first home console on the market to include an internal hard drive by default. This was a breakthrough at the time as it made games run faster that used the HDD and also allowed players to save their progress without the use of a Memory Card. The Xbox shipped with a custom made Intel processor based on the Intel III architecture. This processor allowed faster calculations resulting in a much more realistic gaming experience at the time. nVidia produced the Xboxâ€™s GPU which allowed better graphics than other consoles at the time.\n\n￼The Duke.\n\nWhen first released, the controller (with the exception of the controller found in Japan) was criticized for being abnormally large compared to its competitors. Eventually, it became known as \"The Fatty\" or \"The Duke\" and was replaced with the smaller controller sold in Japan, known as the \"Controller S\" or \"S Type\".\n\nThe system was replaced by the Xbox 360 in 2005 and by the end of 2005 production of the original Xbox had ceased. The final game for the system was Madden NFL 09, released on August 12th 2008.\n\nLaunch Titles\n\nU.S.\n\nHalo: Combat EvolvedOddworld: Munch's OddyseeDead or Alive 3Project Gotham RacingNFL Fever 2002Air Force Delta StormMad Dash RacingCel DamageArctic ThunderFuzion FrenzyTony Hawk's Pro Skater 2X\n\nJapan\n\nJet Set Radio FutureDouble S.T.E.A.L.\n\nEurope\n\nAmped: Freestyle SnowboardingBatman: VengeanceBlood WakeDave Mirra Freestyle BMX 2Dead or Alive 3Fuzion FrenzyHalo: Combat EvolvedJet Set Radio FutureMad Dash RacingMax PayneNBA Live 2002NHL 2002NHL Hitz 2002Oddworld: Munch's OddyseeProject Gotham RacingRalliSport ChallengeTony Hawk's Pro Skater 3TransWorld SurfWreckless: The Yakuza Missions\n\nInnovation\n\nXbox was the first console to include a built in hard drive. Users were able to rip music from their CD collection and listen from the Xbox's hard drive. This also made custom in-game soundtracks possible. The first game to take advantage of this was Rockstar's Grand Theft Auto Double Pack. The Xbox was the first console to charge an annual fee to play online and introduced fully integrated online gaming on home consoles with the introduction of Xbox Live.\n\nSales\n\nWhen the Xbox launched on November 21, 2001, the console quickly sold out in North America. In Japan, however, the console sold only 250,000 units. After its release in November 2004 Halo 2 became the best selling Xbox title worldwide, selling over 8 million copies, thanks in large part to the quality of its online multiplayer through Xbox Live. It was arguably the most popular online mutliplayer shooter on home consoles during the sixth-generation of consoles.\n\nAccording to Microsoft the Xbox has sold over 24 million worldwide as of 2006.\n\nSupport\n\nMicrosoft officially no longer offers console repairs on the Xbox after March 2, 2009. Microsoft is rumored to offer an Xbox 360 upgrade offer to users of the original Xbox. Real support for the Xbox ended on November 22, 2005 with the launch of the console's successor, the Xbox 360. Xbox Live support for the Xbox was discontinued for all Xbox original games on April 15th 2010.\n\nTechnical Specifications\n\nDimensions\n\n320 x 100 x 260 mm (12.5 x 4 x 10.5 in)\n\nWeight\n\n2.4 kg (5 lbs. 5 oz.)\n\nMedia\n\n2-5x DVD\n\n10 GB hard disk\n\n8 MB memory card\n\nInterfaces\n\nController port (4)\n\nMemory Card slot (2)\n\nAV Multi Out connector (1)\n\nUSB connector (2)\n\ni.Link(TM (IEEE1394 connector)\n\nFeatures\n\nAn internal hard drive, for storage of game information -- a first in the console gaming industry.
