        "description": "Founded in 1993 by James Schmalz, Digital Extremes Ltd. proudly ranks as one of the world's top development studios in the interactive entertainment industry.\nHeadquartered in London Ontario, Canada’s 10th largest city, Digital Extremes got its foothold early on in the game industry during the shareware craze of the early 90s. Epic Pinball was a ten month project written entirely in assembly language by Schmalz that went on to become one of the most successful shareware games ever made, trailing only behind such industry greats as Duke3D, Doom and Wolfenstein 3D. Sequels such as Silverball and Extreme Pinball were released shortly thereafter and together they helped fund the creation of what would become one of the industry’s blockbuster franchises, Epic Games’ Unreal®.\n\nBeginning in 1994, Digital Extremes partnered with Epic Games (at that time, its shareware publisher) and co-created Unreal and its counterpart Unreal Tournament. Both games set new standards for first-person action games and broke new ground in online multiplayer gaming. Tremendously rich graphics, fine-tuned gameplay, frenetic action and high quality production value are descriptions that have become synonymous with any Unreal branded game. To date, the award-winning Unreal franchise, including Unreal, Unreal Tournament and Unreal Championship has sold more than 12 million units worldwide across the PC, PlayStation®2, Xbox™ and Dreamcast™ platforms.\n\nDigital Extremes completed development on its original IP for the current generation of consoles, Dark Sector®, which shipped to stores in 2008, using its proprietary next-gen technology, the Evolution Engine™. Following its success, the studio expanded to two teams to allow for simultaneous development on separate projects.\n\nDigital Extremes completed work on the Multiplayer component of 2K Games’ blockbuster, Bioshock® 2 as well as the PC version of THQ hit, Homefront™.  The company also recently ventured into the mobile world with the release of Retro Pinball for Apple’s iOS platform, a throwback to the company’s roots.  More recently, Digital Extremes earned critical acclaim for the development of first-person action game, The Darkness® II, based on the comic book series of the same name.  In addition, the company assisted Microsoft with additional multiplayer content to Halo®4.  The studio is currently developing and publishing the Free-to-Play action game, Warframe",

        "description": "\"Clover Studio was an independent Japanese video game development studio funded by Capcom. The studio consisted largely of existing Capcom R&amp;D talent, who had formed the company (then called Studio 9) to give themselves greater executive control (and thus creative freedom), like Sega's semi-autonomous studios in the early 2000s. The studio focused largely on creating new intellectual property rather than sequels. When these failed to perform on par with Capcom's more popular series, Capcom attempted to merge the studio back into their internal R&amp;D. Those at the studio chose instead to leave the company, and Clover was dissolved.\n\nSome of the key members of Clover founded Seeds Inc., a new development group that merged with ODD Incorporated in October 2007 to form PlatinumGames, which has since built up a staff composed of former Clover staff. Other members (including the art director of Ōkami) went to join Ignition Entertainment at their Tokyo development studio.\"",

It was founded in 2009 by Amir Rao and Gavin Simon, and currently consists of employees in San Jose and other locations. Several of its team members were former developers from the Electronic Arts Los Angeles studio, which developed the Command &amp; Conquer series of video games.\n\nTheir first game, Bastion, received high critical praise, including being listed among several \"Game of the Year\" lists from game journalists. It was first shown in mid-development at the 2010 Penny Arcade Expo as part of its \"PAX 10\" highlight ten upcoming independently developed games. This attracted several publishers who wanted to help distribute the game, but Supergiant Games found that Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment shared the same vision they had for the game. Supergiant selected them as their publishing partner, enabling them not only to distribute the game to Xbox Live Arcade but as a premiere title during the 2011 \"Summer of Arcade\" promotion.\n\nIn March 2013, Supergiant Games announced their next title, Transistor, released on May 20 2014. A promotion video was released March 19. The game features a female protagonist, Red, in a cyberpunk-like city, who had gained possession of a powerful weapon that she is nearly killed for possessing. The game features a similar isometric viewpoint to Bastion. Transistor was similarly met with critical acclaim with an average critic score of 83 on Metacritic.",

To date, their most popular franchise is the critically acclaimed Hitman series. IO Interactive remained a subsidiary of Square Enix until 2017, when its parent started seeking buyers for the studio. IO Interactive completed a management buyout, regaining their independent status and retaining the rights for Hitman and Freedom Fighters, in June 2017. \n \n- \n \nFormerly called \nASX Nr. 14.811 ApS (1990–1991) \nMermaid Invest ApS (1991–1998) \nIO Interactive ApS (1998–2000) \n \nParent company \nSquare Enix (2003–2017) \n- \n \nIt’s simple. Io-Interactive is here to deliver exciting world class entertainment, and we want our games to play and feel like the people who created them. It is our way of making sure that we will always deliver something unique and interesting. This requires not only lots of work but also lots of guts, talented people and a great working environment and we do our utmost to have all of this. \n \nWe’re doing as much as we can to make IOI feel like a second home. We meet in the morning and share breakfast, eat lunch together and party together. On Fridays we sometimes have our Friday bar – either planned as a big thing where we run around in the building with laser guns – or just spontaneously started somewhere in the building. Every now and then we have IOI days where we can dig into our pet projects or attend presentations from colleagues or external experts on everything game related. \n \nAround Christmas, we usually have the house full of all our kids making ginger bread houses and paper cuttings. In the summertime there are often football games going on and besides these three cornerstones of Denmark (food, beer and football) there’s a thing like the monthly board game night where we just go totally analogue. \n \n~ IO Interactive",

We produced three award-winning PS2 games starring the wily raccoon thief Sly Cooper, all of which met with critical acclaim, commercial success, and file cabinets full of fan mail. Some of it written in crayon. \n \nIn 2009, we released the open-world superhero game inFAMOUS, which rapidly turned into the summer’s must-have PS3 game, with excellent reviews and solid footing at the top of the PS3 sales charts. After launching inFAMOUS 2 in 2011, we continued the inFAMOUS franchise on PlayStation 4 in 2013 with Second Son starring Delsin Rowe and standalone DLC First Light starring Abigail ‘Fetch’ Walker. \n \nSucker Punch takes the entire 2nd floor of a skyscraper in downtown Bellevue, looking across Lake Washington to downtown Seattle. We offer a great environment, a friendly set of co-workers, a full benefits package, competitive salaries, and the opportunity to work with one of the best teams around. We’re proud of the games we’ve built, but we’re always looking to get better. We’re excited about strengthening our team with people that share our passion for building visually arresting, emotionally compelling, viscerally involving games.",

The company begun working on four different titles, all of which were finally cancelled once Retro focused their resources on Metroid Prime, the first Metroid title developed outside of Japan.

Thanks to the digital publishing revolution we are able to fund our own ideas and create games that we really want to make, without any outside interference. \n \nOur biggest hit so far was Zombie Driver with it's console remake Zombie Driver HD which we self-published on the PC, Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, Android and Xbox One. The next upcoming game is titled X-Morph: Defense and will be available for PC, Xbox One and PlayStation 4 in 2017. Before X-Morph: Defense and Zombie Driver we worked on a multiplayer car combat game called D.I.P.R.I.P. which was released in 2008 on Steam as one of the first Source Engine mods on the platform.",

From that point, Traveller's Tales served as the company's development branch, while Giant Interactive Entertainment became TT Games Publishing, the publishing branch. In 2007, the company acquired another developer and an animation studio, which became TT Fusion and TT Animation. \n \nOn 8 November 2007, Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment announced that they had purchased TT Games for an undisclosed amount as part of their expansion into the video game industry",

Turn 10 Studios began working on the original Forza Motorsport to fill the void of simulation racing games on the Xbox console. With an emphasis on driving mechanics and the newest features of Xbox LIVE, the original Forza Motorsport was released in May of 2005 to much critical acclaim and community support. \n \nBuilding off its success, Turn 10’s team immediately began working on a sequel intended to be released on Microsoft’s new Xbox 360 console. Forza Motorsport 2 was released in May of 2007, pushing the boundaries of User Generated Content (UGC) with a robust livery editor and online Auction House, giving casual players new options for expressing their creativity on and off the track. With new online tools, the Forza community thrived as painters, tuners, seller, and racers shared their creations via Forzamotorsport.net. \n \nIn late 2007, Turn 10 Studios began an intense development process for the next Forza installment. Our most ambitious project to date, Forza Motorsport 3 boasted enhanced graphics, driving physics, and UGC. Turn 10 released the game in October 2009 to critical and commercial success. \n \nReleased in October of 2011, Forza Motorsport 4 brought even more excitement to the franchise with Kinect integration, including the stunning Autovista experience. With hundreds of cars rendered in stunning detail, and new tracks to hone skills on, Forza Motorsport 4 was another resounding success for Turn 10 Studios. \n \nWith Forza Horizon, the Forza universe expanded to the open road. Action racing put the player in an open world that demands driving skill and rewards driving style. With lots to explore and a cutting-edge soundtrack to compliment the scenery, Horizon was an evolution of the authentic Forza experience. \n \nIn 2013, Turn 10 released Forza Motorsport 5, the first Forza Motorsport game to appear on the newest Xbox console, Xbox One.

        "description": "History\n\n￼Founders of Blizzard (Left to Right): Pearce, Morhaime and Adham\n\nBlizzard Entertainment was founded by Allen Adham, Michael Morhaime and Frank Pearce on February 1991. After graduating from UCLA a year before, the three computing graduates decided to form a gaming company called Silicon & Synapse, which referred to the building block of the computer (silicon) and the human mind (synapse).\n\nUnder that name, the company developed games for the Super NES like Rock n' Roll Racing, The Lost Vikings and Blackthorne. Silicon & Synapse garnered many awards within those years but received backlash for its company name. Many mistook it to be a breast implant firm because of the word \"silicon,\" which led them to briefly changed its name to Chaos Studios but it did not help either. Many people had trouble pronouncing the name (mispronunciations ranged from \"chows\" to \"Chads\") and discovered that another company with the Chaos name already existed.\n\nIn early 1994 they were acquired by distributor Davidson & Associates for $6.75 million. The same year the three year old gaming company switched its name to Ogre Studios but Davidson & Associates went against it because they felt \"ogre\" was too scary for the target audience. Finally, after numerous discussions within the team, they finally settled on Blizzard Entertainment.\n\nOverview\n\nBlizzard's three main intellectual properties include the Warcraft, StarCraft, and Diablo franchises. Each franchise boasts an impressive, and almost \"cult-like\" following of fans, that have made Blizzard one of the most easily recognizable names in the gaming industry today.\n\nIn July 2008 Vivendi Games, who at the time owned Blizzard Entertainment, merged with game publisher Activision. Using Blizzard's name as a marketing tool to promote the company and deal as a merger and not a direct buyout, named the resulting company Activision Blizzard.\n\nConventions\n\n￼A \"Murky\" pet that was given away to attendees of the first Blizzcon in 2005.\n\nIt is due to this incredible community that has developed around these three unique IPs and the unprecedented success of their hit titles like StarCraft and World of Warcraft that Blizzard is able to host it's own convention's; namely BlizzCon and the Worldwide Invitational (or WWI). These conventions boast a number of incredible events such as tournaments for Warcraft 3, StarCraft, Hearthstone and World of Warcraft arena tournaments, costume and machinima contests, as well as major announcements concerning their three flagship franchises.\n\nThe first BlizzCon was held in Anaheim, California at the Anaheim Convention Center in 2005 and has since been held on a semi-regular basis. It has been held since in 2007, 2008, and 2009. In July 2008, Blizzard announced they would be partnering with DirectTV to televise BlizzCon 2008.The third Worldwide Invitational was held in May 2007 in Seoul, Korea and featured the unveiling of the highly anticipated StarCraft II. The fourth WWI was held in Paris, France in June 2008 with the announcement of Diablo III and information concerning the second expansion to their massive multiplayer online RPG World of Warcraft, The Wrath of the Lich King. Previous WWI events were held in Seoul, Korea and featured professional, or \"eSports\" tournaments but no new product announcements.On top of the many prizes and tournaments going on, Blizzard has also made a habit out of giving away special codes that can be redeemed in World of Warcraft for different aesthetic purposes. Things such as in-game pets that follow a player around, or a suit that dresses them up are just a few things that Blizzard has given away exclusively at their events.Blizzard has announced and is holding the next Blizzcon in August of 2009. The convention will, as the previous Blizzcon of 2008, be available to non-attendee's through DirectTV for a nominal fee. It will also be available for purchase to be viewed via a streaming feed online.Blizzard has announced that BlizzCon 2010 is scheduled for October 2010 at the Anaheim Convention Center.Blizzard canceled BlizzCon 2012, in order to have more time to work on their current projects.\n\nBattle.net\n\nIn 1997 Blizzard released an online gaming service called Battle.net that allows players from around the world to play together for free. This service has been implemented into most of Blizzard's titles. Battle.net has an array of functions including a matchmaking service and custom gameplay support that allows players to create their own maps and game types to share and play online. One such game type called Defense of the Ancients (or DoTA) in WarCraft 3 has since grown to become somewhat of a phenomenon similar to the original Counter-Strike mod for Half-Life.\n\nWith the release of StarCraft II, Blizzard announced that an all new Battle.net service titled Battle.net 2.0 will launch concurrently with the game. Battle.net 2.0 features cross game features with all upcoming Blizzard Entertainment games, including backwards compatibility with World of WarCraft.

Blizzard threatened legal action and filed a lawsuit against the developers which eventually caused the service to shut down.The three viking characters (Erik the Swift, Baleog the Fierce, and Olaf the Stout) from Blizzard's game \"The Lost Vikings\" can be found in their MMORPG World of Warcraft in the Uldaman dungeon camping in a side tunnel off of the main zone.Notable title cancellations from Blizzard include Warcraft Adventures: Lord of the Clans which was cancelled in 1998, Shattered Nations, StarCraft: Ghost which was \"indefinetely postponed\" in 2006; and Titan which was cancelled in 2014 after seven years of development, however the \"combat\" portions of the game became what is now Overwatch.Blizzard was honored in 2008 at the 59th Annual Technology & Enginerring Emmy Awards for the creation of World of Warcraft. The award was accepted by Michael Morhaime.It has been announced by Blizzard that they will be producing a live-action Warcraft movie to be released by Legendary Pictures. The film will be released to theaters June 10, 2016.Blizzard was originally to be the company to publish Pax Imperia II but the project was dropped when it was decided that it would be in conflict with their other space-based RTS StarCraft. THQ eventually struck a deal with Heliotrope to have the game published under the title Pax Imperia: Eminent Domain.",

The iPod contained several photos and a short video from \"The Hidden People\", a work done by cartoonist Graham Annable. In 2010, Telltale released Poker Night at the Inventory, a poker game featuring 4 different characters from four different franchises. The game combines Max, from the Sam & Max series of comic books and games (also from Telltale), Strong Bad from the Homestar Runner website, Heavy Weapons Guy from Valve's Team Fortress 2, and Tycho Brahe from the Penny Arcade web comic. Together with the player, they play no limits Texas Hold'em, while engaging in humorous conversations with each other. In December 2010 they released the first episode of Back to the Future: The Game. The planned Jurassic Park episodic series was supposed to debut soon after, but was delayed until November 2011. In April 2011 Telltale also released three episodes of Hector: Badge of Carnage, originally an iPhone/iPod Touch game by animation studio Straandlooper.\n\nLatest\n\nIn 2012 Telltale made Law & Order Legacies, based on the TV show.

Quite amazingly, we’re probably still best known for The City of Metronome – a game that we never actually made – but we’re hoping all that is about to change!\n\nThe future of Tarsier Studios lies in our own original ideas, and the first of these is a game that is very much a spiritual successor to Metronome, whilst also fashioning a unique identity of its own. It is a game called Hunger.\"",

        "description": " Overview\n\n￼   King Graham The King's Quest series chronicles the saga of the royal family of the Kingdom of Daventry through their various trials and adventures. The story takes place over two generations and across many lands, including Daventry, Kolyma, Llewdor, Tamir, Serenia, Eldritch, Etheria and the Land of the Green Isles.  The series spans a total of 8 games across 14 years, starting in 1984 with King’s Quest: Quest for the crown to the release of King's Quest: Mask of Eternity in 1998. There have also been numerous re-releases and collections, most notably the original game, which had a total of 10 re-releases.  \n\nThe main characters in the series are Sir (later King) Graham and members of his family: his wife, Valanice, and his twin son and daughter, Alexander and Rosella. The exception is KQ VIII, where the protagonist is Connor, a tanner in the Kingdom of Daventry who is unrelated to the royal family. Because of this and the emphasis on RPG and action elements in KQ VIII, many fans refuse to consider it a true sequel and call it KQ:MOE (for Mask of Eternity, the game's subtitle). \n\nMany famous fictional characters make appearances in the series, including Beauty and the Beast, Rumplestiltskin, Red Riding Hood and Count Dracula. They are featured most prominently in the earlier games, which focus on solving item-based puzzles in a fantasy setting. The later sequels have more elaborate story lines, more complicated puzzles, and more original and realistic characters. \n\nOverall Gameplay\n\n￼ Take anything not nailed down. Beginning with the original game and used until the fifth game in the series, the player's interaction with the game consisted entirely of typing commands into the game's parser, then reading the parser's response.  As the first adventure game to integrate graphical animation into the player's view of game world, King's Quest shifted the focus away from the static scenery, to the player's character, which was now animated on-screen. As the player used the keyboard to explore the game world, the on-screen character, King Graham, was animated walking to the chosen destination. There were animation sequences for most player-world interactions reachable through the normal course of exploration. For example, there were different animation sequences showing King Graham picking up objects from the ground, opening doors, and wading through water. Depth perspective was simulated as well; Graham could walk behind objects, causing his character to be 'hidden' from view, or walk in front of them, obscuring the object. This attention to graphical animation, while commonplace in arcade-action games, earned King's Quest the distinction as the first \"3D-animated\" adventure game. \n\nKing’s Quest V: Absence Makes the Heart Go Yonder was the first King's Quest game to replace the typing user interface with a point-and-click user interface. Instead of typing commands, players used a series of icons to navigate the game.  Most often throughout the series, as with other adventure games, these icons included “walk” as a character icon, “talk” as a mouth, “look” as an eye,  and “use” as a hand. \n\nAll games in the series, with the exception of King's Quest: Mask of Eternity, used the standard adventure game paradigm by presenting the player with puzzles they must solve with items from their inventory.  The last game in the series departed from traditional methods and instead went to full 3D and used more of the current, at the time, RPG methods of play – including combat. \n\nNotable Development History\n\n￼￼ The start of a series \n\nKing’s Quest I\n\nReleased in 1983 by IBM as a demonstration product for their IBM PCjr, King's Quest I is not only the first \"animated\" adventure game, it was also the first Sierra game to use the AGI engine. (However, the AGI engine wasn't known as such until King's Quest II.) Since the IBM PCjr didn't sell particularly well, the game was later released directly by Sierra for IBM PCs in addition to other platforms such as the Amiga, Atari ST and Sega Master System.  \n\nKing's Quest I was innovative in its use of 16-color graphics on the PCjr and Tandy 1000; even CGA owners could enjoy 16-color graphics if they used a composite monitor or TV. The level of interaction with the graphics was an enormous leap over the mostly un-animated \"rooms\" of previous graphical interactive fiction. \n\nKing’s Quest: Mask of Eternity \n\nAlthough not described as KQ8 in the released game (other than being described as the eighth title in the series on a sticker placed on shrink wrap), a folder in the King's Quest Collection 2 contained a preview video for the game that was entitled, KQ8AVI. \n\nRoberta Williams had said in interviews at the time that she no longer liked the idea of roman numerals or numbers designating sequels and wanted to distance the later sequels in the series from the use of them. She gave several reasons for her choice to remove the numbers, one being that numbers might give a bad impression to the fans that might think that the sequel wasn't nearly as good as the games coming before it, as is often the case with sequels to movies. \n \n\nNotable Locations \n\n￼￼ \n\nDaventry\n\nDaventry can refer to several things: Properly, it's the name of the Kingdom of Daventry, but the name can be also used to refer to the world in which the King's Quest games take place, the World of Daventry. The name can also refer to Castle Daventry, the great keep and seat of power for the Kingdom of Daventry, and Daventry town ( which is not far from from the castle), and in some cases it is an alternate title for the continent of Serenia. \n\nAccording to the King's Quest Companion; \"World of Daventry\" or simply \"Daventry\" is a name humans may use for the entire world where King's Quest's lands are located, although this is not the proper name of the planet. The world appears to actually be earth from a long time ago in the distant past, and like the present earth shares the solar system with at least Jupiter. At several points in history magical beings withdrew into Daventry to avoid persecution by the increasingly scientific societies. The world is continued to be called \"Earth\" by the gnomes from the Underground Realm of the Gnomes, and the occasional human (according to the games and manuals).\n\nThe Kingdom of Daventry, aka the realm of Daventry, is main Daventry on the continent of Daventry/Serenia. It is the home of Royal Family of Daventry, King Graham, Queen Valanice and their two children. Daventry is a very old kingdom and had its share of good and bad kings over the thousands of years of its existence.  Daventry is the greatest kingdom on the continent, and there is a great deal of evidence to support his belief. The Town of Daventry and Connor's Village are located not far from the castle. \n\n￼￼ \n\nKolyma\n\nThe map of World of Daventry in King's Quest Companion shows its location as being southeast of the kingdom of Daventry and directly south of Land of the Green Isles in the Southern Sea The western side of Kolyma folds back upon itself to both the north and south, forever bringing travelers back to where they started. Geographers say that the \"magical law of \"containment\" operates in the western part of the continent. For reasons forgotten, or perhaps it was whimsy on the part of the multiverse--movement to both the north and south in this part of Kolyma eventually turned back upon itself, contained as if inside some transparent cosmic donut. East and west, one could travel at will until confronted by more physical barriers--the sea or mountains for instance--but those that journeyed far enough north of south, would always get back to where they started.  \n\nThere are mentions that vampires hunt this land at night, with ghouls and ghosts as their grim companions. They rule the dark from the castle on the island in the middle of a poisonous lake. The Monks will shelter the occasional traveler to protect them from the undead. Because of the danger of the undead most folk live on the eastern shores of Kolyma beyond the chasm and the mountain. With the only passage between the mountains being the Magical Doorway which will send people elsewhere if they don't have the proper key. The western shore is guarded by the King of the Sea. These various barriers have, with only occasional exceptions kept the Children of the Night Isolated. \n\n￼￼ \n\nLlewdor\n\nIt is one of the two main kingdoms on the continent of Tanalore, along with Tamir. It was the land where Gwydion was forced to be a slave to the wizard Manannan. The main city in Llewdor is known as Port Bruce, and it includes a bar/pub/restaurant, a general store, and a dock. Bandits reside in Llewdor, as does Medusa in the desert to the west, and the Three Bears. It is here that Gwydion partially discovers who he is and is captured by pirates on his way home to Daventry. Sir David of Bruce came from this land.  \n\nThe Magical Law of \"Containment\" occurs in the land, causing the north and south to bend back upon itself, so that anyone traveling north, will end up coming up from the south, or vice versa.\n\nTamir\n\nTamir was a land visited during King's Quest IV: The Perils of Rosella. It is one of the two main kingdoms on the continent of Tanalore along with Llewdor. Tamir was the land that was cared for by the fairy Genesta. Unfortunately the evil fairy, Lolotte, wanted to be ruler of the land. That land also housed a magic fruit that would heal the sick.\nThe land is comprised of beach, meadowlands, forest, Scary Woods, Impossible Mountains, and the Death Bogs of Tamir. The seven Dwarfs, Cupid, Pan, and Edgar also resided there. \n\nThe Magical Law of \"Containment\" occurs in the land, causing the north and south to bend back upon itself, so that anyone traveling north, will end up coming up from the south, or vice versa.\n\n￼￼ \n\nSerenia\n\nSerenia is the is name of the continent where the Sovereignty of Serenia, Kingdom of Daventry and several other smaller nations are located. The continent is also known as Daventry, as for a time that kingdom was only land on the continent as the northern Serenia had mysteriously vanished (but later reappeared around 24 GC). Other Continents in the world include Kolyma and Tanalore, and an unnamed continent north of Serenia, where Harlin's castle was located. Serenia can also refer to Serenia towne and the Village of Serenia. \n\nThis land first appeared in The Wizard and the Princess and Adventure in Serenia, and was later revisited in King's Quest V.\n\nThe continent was originally called Daventry in King's Quest Companion, First Edition, and King's Quest 3. As shown in the book and game during the era's of King's Quest 1-4, the Sovereignty of Serenia was missing. The KQ3 Charts, 1st Edition Maps and Alexander's account of his escape from Manannan show that Serenia was missing at the time (and the continent was referred to as Daventry). In the Second Edition, Serenia reappeared, and the book uses the name Daventry and Serenia interchangeably for the name of the continent. The continent is referred to as Daventry in the An Encyclopedia of Daventry in the 2nd Edition. The 2nd Edition Maps and 3rd Edition Maps show the continent being referred to as Daventry as well.\n\nEldritch\n\nThe Realm of Eldritch is a magical realm, filled with many mythical and powerful people and beings. As said above, Eldritch is a land of magic and almost everyone who lives there knows magic or is of magic. Many of the residents of Eldritch, particularly those in Etheria, the capital of Eldritch, are Fairies who are primordial beings and gods and goddesses. Other citizens of Etheria include spirits of the land and air. Eldritch is ruled by the king and queen, Oberon and Titania, who also are the king and queen of Fairies. Eldritch consists of the Vulcanix Underground, Ooga Booga, Bountiful Woods, Were-Woods, Etheria, Nonsense Land and Falderal.\n\n\nEtheria  \n\nEtheria also known as the Faerieland or the Land in the Clouds[1] is a heavenly realm above Eldritch, the capital of that land, and is the home of fairies, ruled by Titania and Oberon. Etheria is a land set upon the clouds, and some of the deities and powers of the world of Daventry continent reside in Etheria, along with other mystical and magical people and beings.\nEtheria is a land of clouds, rainbows, beauty and sweet song, and one of its greatest places is its amazing city of the same name. Time moves faster in Etheria than it does in Daventry.\n\n￼￼ \n\nLand of the Green Isles.  \n\nThe Land of the Green Isles is the name for a land and kingdom comprised of a chain of islands (though not all islands of the chain are part of the kingdom). \n\nAn ancient and peaceful kingdom, the Land of the Green Isles has long been the subject of much debate as to whether the land is a reality or if it is just a work of a great imagination. Until recently, the land was largely dismissed as being myth. The Land consists of four main islands; the Isle of the Crown (the island from which the king and queen rule), the Isle of Wonder, the Isle of the Sacred Mountain, and the Isle of the Beast (formerly the Isle of the Forest). \n\nA fifth island sometimes stays around long enough to be counted as a semi-permanent member of the insular community, the Isle of the Mists. It is visible and visitable only when the Druids can cast and maintain an earth spell to blow away the island's eternal fog. \n\nMythology\n\nMuch of King's Quest was inspired by fairy tales, which designer Roberta Williams loved reading. Many creatures, characters and situations from mythology, fairy tales, and folklore are encountered within the world of King's Quest. A Minotaur, Pan, Pandora, Charon, Cupid, Ceres, Druids, Harpies, Oracles, Neptune, Medusa, The Fates and the Graeae appear in various games in the series. In general, the mythology of the King's Quest world is derived from that of the Ancient Greeks, Romans, and Celts. \n\nMagic plays a large role in the King's Quest series. Wizards, witches, enchanters, sorcerers, and genies appear throughout. In some of the games (most prominently in KQIII), the main character must use magic spells or items to achieve a goal. \n\nOfficial King’s Quest Timeline\n\nKQ1 is designated as the year 0 GC date. GC (Graham's Coronation) is an unofficial designation for what is the equivalent to KQ1. These are derived only from official sources, with KQ1 designated as the starting date. Later timelines are inconsistent with the official timeline, and dates are off by a couple years. \n\nOfficial sources may not always be consistent. For example; The introductory story in KQ2 manual originally implied that events of KQ2 took place one year after KQ1, according to the KQ4 manual he saw Valanice in the magic mirror and left on the adventure three years after KQ1, the KQV Hintbook placed the events of KQ2 several years after KQ1 (implying it was more than three years). \n\nThe KQV Hintbook has other discrepencies. According to KQ4 the royal twins were born two years after KQ2, which is supported by age of twins given in later sources in relation to dates given in those sources (KQ6 Hintbook, King's Quest Companion, KQ7, etc). The KQV hintbook states that the birth of the twins was one year after the events of KQ2 (which doesn't fit with other references). King's Quest Companion states that Alexander was kidnapped by shores of Lake Maylie during a summer picnic. The KQV Hintbook places the kidnapping in the castle nursery. KQV Hintbook also contains a possible discrepency for when Alexander was kidnapped by Manannan. It states that he was kidnapped exactly six months after his birth. However creates problems with other known details in relation to other sources; Alexander's was a few weeks from his eighteenth birthday, the story took place during late summer, and that See No Weevil places the twins birthdays in early autumn. If Alexander was born during early Autumnn, as per See No Weevil and supported by KQ3, and kidnapped during the summer (according to King's Quest Companion), then it would imply that Alexander could have been kidnapped up to nine months after his birth. King's Quest Hintbook's six month date (from autumn birthdate) would place his kidnapping in during late winter, early spring. The KQV Hintbook also places the events of KQ1 during the spring, but it is unclear what affects, if any, that would have on the timeline.",

        "name": "Alice: Madness Returns",
        "description": "Within events of the first game, Alice Liddell, believing herself responsible for a fire that consumed her home and her family, escapes into a twisted version of Wonderland. While held at Rutledge Asylum for treatment, Alice was able to conquer her doubts, and eventually was released from the ward. Madness Returns takes place in 1875, a year after Alice's release. Alice, now 19 years old,[6] resides at an orphanage in Victorian London, under the care of Dr. Angus Bumby, a psychiatrist who uses hypnosis to help his child patients forget their memories. Though she believes that she is fine, Alice still suffers from hallucinations of Wonderland. \n \nDuring an errand, Alice is struck by a hallucination and believes herself to be in Wonderland again. Though initially idyllic, the peaceful land quickly becomes corrupted by the Infernal Train that rampages through it, leaving behind the Ruin, a force that attempts to stop Alice. Alice meets with the Cheshire Cat who affirms that it is some outside force, not Alice, that has caused this corruption, and urges her to seek out former friends and foes to discover the source of the Train. Throughout the rest of the game, Alice briefly returns to reality between episodes occurring within Wonderland. In the real world, Alice learns from the family lawyer that her sister, Elizabeth (nicknamed \"Lizzie\"), was first to die in the fire, despite being the farthest from its source, and had been locked in her room. \n \nWithin the corrupted Wonderland, Alice attempts to learn more from Wonderland's various citizens, including the Duchess, the Mad Hatter, the Mock Turtle, the Walrus and the Carpenter, and the Caterpillar. She is ultimately told that the Queen of Hearts still lives despite her defeat at Alice's hands before, though in a diminished capacity. At the Queen's castle, Alice discovers the Queen's true form, which resembles her younger self. The Queen reveals that an entity called the Dollmaker has taken over the Infernal Train and is corrupting Wonderland. \n \nReturning to London, Alice starts to recall her memories of the night of the fire and realizes that Dr. Bumby was there. He is responsible for the death of her sister and her whole family. She comes to the conclusion that Dr. Bumby is attempting to erase the memories of the fire from her mind and, as he has done with other children, trying to leave her as a \"blank toy\" to be taken by abusive masters and child molesters for a price. Furious, Alice confronts both Dr. Bumby in the real world at the Moorgate station and Dr. Bumby's Wonderland counterpart, the Dollmaker, in her fantasy on the Infernal Train. Dr. Bumby admits to his crimes, and even attests to setting Alice's home on fire after Lizzie refused his advances, removing any witnesses to his having raped her that night. He points out that by wiping out her Wonderland, he will make her forget the events of that night, while he will continue as a member of high society. Alice defeats the Dollmaker in Wonderland, giving her the strength in the real world and in her mind to push Dr. Bumby into the path of an oncoming train, killing him. \n \nAs Alice leaves the station, she finds herself in a hybrid vision of London mixed with Wonderland, Londerland. Alice wanders into the unknown terrain as the Cheshire Cat monologues that Alice has found the truth that was \"worth the pain fighting for\", and Wonderland, though damaged, is safe for the time being.\n\nReturn to Wonderland and experience an all new nightmare as Alice fights to regain her sanity as she fights for the truth behind her past. Can Alice save Wonderland - and herself - from the madness that consumes them both?",

While Banjo and Kazooie are eating pizza, playing video games and listening to the radio, they discover Gruntilda's detached head returning to Spiral Mountain. They are about to fight when they are stopped by Lord of Games (L.O.G.). He attempts to settle the conflict between the two by devising a series of worlds and challenges.

The game ends with Gruntilda and Banjo attempting to face a final duel when L.O.G. once again comes in to stop them. After L.O.G. sends Gruntilda off to toil away at his video game factory, he rewards Banjo and Kazooie by restoring their moves and giving them the deeds to Spiral Mountain.

The game stays close to the visual style and the mechanics of the 2011 reboot. The main controls are still based on two types of punches and kicks, and blocking, to form combos with uppercuts, teleports, special moves that incorporate weapons and fatalities. The three-tiered energy from the previous title returns, making available X-Ray moves, powered up EX moves and combo breakers. As introduced in Injustice: Gods Among Us, characters can use the environment to re-position themselves or optionally use parts as weapons. Each character now has three variations with different moves and weapons. There is once again a sprinting gauge, returning from Mortal Kombat 4.",

Demons came in droves and forced the twin Goddesses who ruled the land to whisk their subjects away from the surface, into the safe embrace of the clouds. The demons were persistent, however, erecting a massive tower in pursuit. The battle that raged upon the ground had begun ascending for a second round up above. \nOne day, amidst this turmoil, the Goddesses stole away into the night, vanishing from Ys altogether. And there's only one place they could have gone: the Devil's Tower. \n \nA search party of knights and sorcerers was hastily formed and dispatched to the surface in hopes of retrieving these runaway deities. Among its members were apprentice knight Yunica Tovah and troubled sorcerer Hugo Fact. \n \nThis is their story. Or at least, it's how each of them remembers it. \n \nExpanding upon the gameplay elements introduced in Ys: The Ark of Napishtim and further developed in Ys: The Oath in Felghana, Ys Origin perfects the formula by adding different styles of play and new features never before seen in the Ys universe. Best described as an arcade-like platformer RPG with Metroidvania elements and a complex, multi-faceted narrative, Ys Origin is the perfect mix of action, exploration and story. Screen-filling bosses with complex AI, unique platforming elements, innovative puzzles and a deeply involving mystery await within the wildly varied confines of this classic Ys dungeon. \n \nCome see how long you can last in the Devil's Tower...",

With your swordsmanship and spells, can you banish evil from the land of your ancestors?\"",

With courage in her heart, she faced the false gods who ruled over people for centuries. \n \nHer unfaltering determination changed the world. The gods were vanquished, their plans to massacre the human race destroyed. As Cocoon fell, a single pillar formed, connecting the ravaged world to the one below―Pulse, the underworld. It was the beginning of a new era. \n \nHowever, she was nowhere to be found. Everyone was convinced she was gone―with the exception of her sister, Serah Farron. \n \nThree years later, a single meteorite falls from the sky.

A military force known as BAHRAM sends its primary offensive unit to attack Antilia, a Jupiter colony, in an attempt to secure two advanced machines known as Orbital Frames. One of the few colony survivors, a young boy named Leo Stenbuck, witnesses a falling Laborious Extra-Orbital Vehicle (LEV) killing his friends. He flees to a hangar, where he finds an Orbital Frame by the name of Jehuty. Using this suit and its built-in intelligence, A.D.A, he fends off the BAHRAM forces led by officer Viola who seek to claim Jehuty on the orders of their leader, Nohman. Leo is then contacted by Elena Weinberg, the commander of the civilian transport vessel Atlantis; it belongs to Earth's military forces, the United Nations Space Force. As Jehuty's original pilot died during the attack, Elena requests Leo's assistance to deliver Jehuty back to them so they can take it to Mars. Leo, however, refuses to kill enemies. \n \nBattling through Antilia, Leo rescues civilians, including Celvice Klein, a friend; he defends the colony from destruction, defeating the BAHRAM forces and their commanders one by one. Before reaching Atlantis, Leo encounters Viola, who seeks a rematch; Leo defeats her, but is unwilling to kill her. Later, Atlantis pilot Rock Thunderheart meets Leo in person, revealing that BAHRAM forces are still determined to obtain Jehuty and are threatening to destroy the colony. Thunderheart requests Leo's help to pilot Jehuty, as he has realized Leo's skills are superior. Viola then appears, shooting Celvice this time, forcing Leo to fight again. Celvice is taken to the Thunderheart to be treated while Leo goes to save the colony. \n \nLeo goes to the docks and Viola battles him once more. However, Viola is defeated again and killed when a leftover bomb blows her out of the colony and into Jupiter's atmosphere. Nohman himself then appears in Jehuty's superior twin Frame Anubis, forcing Jehuty's escape. As Jehuty is docking, A.D.A. reveals to Leo its programming: when taken to the fortress Aumaan on Mars, the mechas is to eject its pilot and self-destruct Jehuty, destroying the frame and the fortress. Leo leaves Jehuty's cockpit and meets up with the crew of the Atlantis and Celvice, who survived her gunshot wound.\n\nRelive the adventure for the first time in HD!

This ship is quite large, and is able to land on at least 5 planets or other space-based destinations. Players are able to travel through the \"star ocean,\" jumping across planets. The game takes place a few centuries before the original Star Ocean (around S.D. 10, or approximately 2087 AD). The game's plot revolves around Edge and his crew combating a mysterious threat called the \"Grigori\". \n \nAn international version of the game was released by Square Enix as a worldwide PlayStation 3-exclusive on February 9, 2010.

Gabriel defeats the werewolf Cornell and the vampire Carmilla for the first two pieces of the God Mask on his journey, while learning that they were once two of the three founding members of the Order who fought the spawns of Satan in God's favor until they transformed into the Spirits, with power only second to God's.

The game was developed by MercurySteam and published by Konami. This is MercurySteam's last contribution to the franchise. The story is set in both medieval and modern worlds.\n\nAs in the previous game, the player controls Gabriel Belmont, now known as Dracula, as he fights through an open world. During the game's opening sequence the player is able to control Dracula while he still possesses all his powers as well as all of his weapons. Dracula's main weapon is his Blood Whip, a weapon that is comparable to the Combat Cross from the original Lords of Shadow. Replacing the magic system from the previous game are the Void Sword and the Chaos Claws. The Void Sword can replenish Dracula's health when used while the Chaos Claws can be used to break through enemy defenses and deliver powerful attacks. The story mode in Lords of Shadow 2 has been stated to be far longer than the previous one. The game is mainly an open world allowing the player to choose what route to take. This game also features a movable camera, something that was not available in the first Lords of Shadow game.",

He has been warned by Zobek of the return of Satan and sets out to regain his powers so that he may face Satan once again. The key to him regaining his power lies in his castle.

King of Fighters XIII was released for Japanese arcades on July 14, 2010, while ports for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 were during late 2011 in Japan and English regions, with Atlus and Rising Star Games being in charge of releasing them in the United States and Europe respectively. Mobile versions for the iOS and Android operating systems followed in 2011–2012. A PC version was released on Steam on September 13, 2013. Critical reception has been positive and the game has either won or been nominated to multiple Game of the Year type awards. \n \nThe game is set after the events from The King of Fighters XI and is also the conclusion of Ash Crimson's story arc, which started in The King of Fighters 2003. It follows another King of Fighters tournament secretly hosted by Those From the Distance Land, the organization behind the events from the two prior games that are trying to break the seal of the demon Orochi and take its power. \n \nReleased after The King of Fighters XII, the game was directed by Kei Yamamoto who wanted to bring elements from prior The King of Fighters titles and fix issues from the prior game. This title significantly modifies the gameplay from its predecessor, removing some modes, and adding ones formerly used in the series. It also expands the character roster, re-grouping the playable characters into three-member teams as in the prior installments. The ports are notable for including more content than the original version such as new characters, stages and game modes.",

Taking a job at the Genda Law Office, Yagami accepts a high-profile case: Proving Shinpei Okubo, a man suspected of murder, innocent.\n\nAgainst all odds, Yagami succeeds and is hailed as a hero, but his prolific career is short-lived. Only months later, Okubo brutally murders his girlfriend, stabbing her over ten times with a kitchen knife before setting their apartment on fire.\n\nYagami becomes the lawyer who let a murderer walk - and everything he had worked for comes crashing down.\n\nThree years later, Yagami has taken off his lawyer's badge to run a small detective agency in the red-light district of Kamurocho, scraping by on odd jobs and evidence collection.\n\nBut even a city as seedy as this is shaken by a string of serial murders, where the victims' bodies are discovered with their eyes gouged out. Yagami is drawn into the case by his old law firm, where he discovers that in order to bring this killer to light, he must seek the truth that slipped from his grasp three years ago. But can a man haunted by his failures prevail over his own past?\n\nJudgment is an action-adventure game played from a third-person perspective. The game is a legal thriller set in the Yakuza world of Kamurocho and follows private detective Takayuki Yagami as he investigates a serial murder case. It stars Japanese actor Takuya Kimura and employs a fighting system similar to that of Yakuza 0 where players can change into different styles, namely crane-style which is more focused on fighting groups and tiger-style which is more focused on fighting individuals. Additionally, the game features an investigation mode where the player must find traces of the criminal.",

It’s another to humiliate them. Hover jets, human cannonball cars and outrageous melee weapons are all part of the fun.\nCrazy Character Customisation – Create the most outlandish characters ever seen, from washed-up celebrities to maskless ninja pirates. Inside every sinner, there is a Saint. Who will you become?\nOver The Top Co-op – Fly solo or play online with a homie.

        "description": "The game follows Alexander J. Mercer (voiced by Barry Pepper) who wakes up in a morgue in the basement of Gentek, a genetic engineering company based in Manhattan, sending a pair of scientists that were just about to perform an autopsy running. Alex escapes, and witnesses the scientists being gunned down by military operatives. Alex is discovered and attacked. He survives bullets being fired into his chest, and leaps over a wall to safety. He soon discovers he now possesses powerful shapeshifting abilities, superhuman strength, speed, agility, durability, senses, endurance, weaponry and the ability to \"consume\" people to gain their memories, skills and appearance. With no memory of his previous life, Alex decides to find and consume those related to the conspiracy in order to uncover the truth. During his quest, Alex faces two factions: the United States Marine Corps and Blackwatch, a Fort Detrick special forces unit dedicated to combating biological warfare; and the Infected, monsters created by a virus known as BLACKLIGHT that is overrunning Manhattan. Captain Robert Cross (voiced by Jeffrey Pierce), a Blackwatch officer, is given orders to find and contain Alex. \n \nAlex makes contact with his sister, Dana (voiced by Lake Bell), who assists him in tracking down targets, leading to the infiltration of Gentek headquarters. He finds a young woman called Elizabeth Greene contained in the building. Greene is a host for BLACKLIGHT and upon her escape unleashes it upon Manhattan. Dana directs Alex to Karen Parker, his ex-girlfriend. She agrees to aid him in stopping the virus, while requiring Alex to bring back samples of the virus. Karen later leads Alex into a trap, where he is confronted by Cross. During their battle, Alex almost defeated Cross when Cross mentioned 'Penn Station', triggering a flashback that leaves Alex dazed. Alex is injected with a parasite that threatens to kill him. Alex seeks help from Dr. Ragland, a pathologist linked to Gentek. Ragland helps Alex remove the parasite and turn it into a weapon against Greene. However, it has no effect on Greene as her body rejected the parasite immediately, and the rejected biomass forms a monstrous being, the Supreme Hunter, which Alex kills. \n \nThe origins of the virus and Elizabeth Greene are uncovered through a contact: in 1969 the government tested the virus' predecessor in Hope, Idaho, designed to target predetermined races. The virus mutated into something far more deadly, and the whole population was infected. Elizabeth Greene was the sole survivor; an anomaly in her body's biology accepted the virus, rewriting her genetic code along with that of her unborn son, codenamed PARIAH. The remaining population of Hope, Idaho, was liquidated by Blackwatch. Greene and PARIAH were kept in captivity for further research. \n \nAlex discovers his own past: Blackwatch shut down the Gentek project due to leaks and ordered all project personnel eliminated. Alex Mercer took a sample of BLACKLIGHT as \"insurance\". Eventually pinned down by Blackwatch in Penn Station. Alex, in a final act of desperation and vengeance shatters the vial containing the BLACKLIGHT, releasing the virus before being gunned down. The virus entered Mercer's bloodstream through the bullet holes and repaired his body at the cellular level. \n \nThe contact and Alex pump a new \"BLOODTOX\" biological agent underground in order to drive the virus above ground where it can be fought directly, causing Greene to emerge, encased in a towering monstrosity. Greene falls from the monster in human form once she is defeated, and is consumed by Alex. Through her memories, it becomes apparent that General Randall, head of Blackwatch, is prepared to destroy Manhattan with a nuclear weapon. The contact, revealed to be Cross. Alex with the Captains help, infiltrates the USS Ronald Reagan to stop Randall. Once Alex consumes Randall, Cross is revealed to be the Supreme Hunter, who assumed Cross' identity after consuming him, and attacks Alex, asserting that when Blackwatch leaves NYZ they will no longer be searching for infected, and that after he consumes Alex, he will then be strong enough survive the nuclear detonation. Alex defeats the Supreme Hunter and moves the weapon out into the Atlantic Ocean with a helicopter, where it detonates and catches him in the blast. His remains float back to the city and regenerate after consuming a crow. \n \nDuring the credits, it is revealed that the public considers the military to have been the one who stopped the infection; a US Senator is heard telling the media that the events in Manhattan were a case of nuclear and biological terrorism, and promises retribution upon those responsible. Alex, reflecting on the events that occurred and the truth he uncovered about himself, claims he has \"become something less than human, but also something more\". After the credits, Manhattan is shown to be slowly recovering, the virus has been almost completely eradicated. Alex, standing on top of the Reuters Building in Times Square, comments that his work is almost done.\n\nPrototype is the first of two games, and let's the user take control of Alex Mercer as he fights to stop the viral outbreak known as BLACKLIGHT throughout Manhattan. Alex is himself infected by the virus, which has given him special, mutant, abilities that will evolve with time and aid him in stopping the virus.",
        "description_short": "The game follows Alexander J. Mercer (voiced by Barry Pepper) who wakes up in a morgue in the basement of Gentek, a genetic engineering company based in Manhattan, sending a pair of scientists that were just about to perform an autopsy running. Alex escapes, and witnesses the scientists being gunned down by military operatives. Alex is discovered and attacked. He survives bullets being fired into his chest, and leaps over a wall to safety. He soon discovers he now possesses powerful shapeshiftin ...",

        "description": "Two years after the events of the original game, Sergeant James Heller, after returning from touring in Iraq, discovers his wife and daughter to be declared dead, causing him to rejoin the military in the fight for NYZ against the Blacklight virus. Heller is briefed on the previous outbreaks in Idaho in the '60s and in NYZ in the events of the first game. He later finds Mercer and begins chasing him. \n \nPursuing Mercer for vengeance, Heller is infected by Mercer with a strain that imbues him with similar superhuman abilities. After blacking out, Heller awakens in a Yellow Zone lab where Gentek scientist Dr. Anton Koenig and Blackwatch Col. Douglas Rooks are experimenting on him. Heller escapes from the Gentek base, when Mercer confronts him and claims Gentek and Blackwatch are responsible for recreating and cultivating the Blacklight virus, making them responsible for the second infection and the deaths of Heller's family. Revealing his plans to take down Gentek and Blackwatch, Mercer offers a truce to Heller. Unsure of Mercer's intentions Heller goes to his local pastor, Father Luis Guerra, for advice and help. \n \nUsing information supplied by Guerra, Heller hacks into Blacknet Terminals to find out about and sabotage a number of their operations. Gradually consuming his way through Blackwatch, Heller eventually finds and confronts Koenig, who claims to be on his side and reveals Blackwatch's super-soldier program, codenamed \"Orion\". Heller prevents Project: Orion's progress by killing a super-soldier who was injected with his DNA. After consuming one of the head scientists, Heller discovers that Koenig was observing him in order to find his weaknesses. Enraged at Koenig's betrayal, Heller tracks him down only to discover that he has powers similar to he and Mercer, and is one of several \"Evolved\" agents planted in Gentek and Blackwatch by Mercer. After defeating and consuming the doctor, Mercer reveals to Heller that he intends to recruit him in an attempt to control NYZ. His doubts growing, Guerra then shows Heller a video tape of Mercer releasing the virus for the second time in Penn Station, the same place Mercer originally released and contracted the virus. \n \nEnraged at Mercer's deception, Heller sets off to the Green Zone to hunt down Mercer's henchmen, including an Evolved agent in Gentek named Sabrina Galloway; upon confronting Galloway, however, Heller reluctantly teams up with her when she reveals she can help him take down Mercer. With Galloway's help, Heller soon finds that Mercer plans to infect the entire world through \"Whitelight\", a contaminated vaccine released by Gentek that actually serves to accelerate infection and evolution rather than prevent it. \n \nFrustrated with Heller sabotaging his plans, Mercer kills Father Guerra; upon finding his corpse, however, a grieving Heller uses Guerra's phone to reach Athena, Guerra's contact who is revealed to be Dana Mercer. Dana explains that Heller's daughter, Maya, is still alive, prompting Heller to head for the Red Zone to take down Mercer and save Maya. After preventing Blackwatch's second attempt to level Manhattan Island, Rooks helps Heller reach his daughter, only for Galloway to betray him and take Maya to Mercer. Upon confronting Mercer, he reveals that he plans to solve international conflicts and world problems by infecting the entire human race, effectively creating a Superorganism with Maya at the center. After Mercer absorbs Galloway and the remaining Evolved, the two engage in a bloody duel, only for James to emerge victorious and to kill and consume Mercer. \n \nSubsequently, Heller wipes out the infected in NYZ along with most of the Blacklight Virus; then using Mercer's absorbed memories, Heller locates and frees Maya and Dana from a vault. The story then ends with the three overlooking New York before Dana questions what to do next.\n\nPrototype 2 is an open-world action game published by Activision and developed by Radical Entertainment. It's a direct sequel to Prototype and was announced at the 2010 Spike Video Game Awards. \n \nThe events of Prototype 2 takes place in New York City, now known as New York Zero (NYZ), following Sgt. James Heller on his quest to destroy Alex Mercer, after having lost everything and everyone he loved to the Blacklight virus.",

It is a single-player only game that BioWare co-CEO Ray Muzyka describes as a \"spiritual successor\" to the Baldur's Gate series, though it is not based on Dungeons & Dragons rules or the Forgotten Realms setting. It utilizes a new BioWare-developed engine named Eclipse.\n\nThe designers incorporated origin stories for each race and some classes in the game. For example, a dwarf who is a member of the noble caste will begin the game as part of the royal family in one of the dwarven cities, while a dwarf commoner will begin on the streets of the city. Origin stories provide an introduction to the game world and hours of gameplay. People that the Warden meets during the origin story may reappear throughout the game, some of whom may be adversaries.",

The choices you make guide the path you take through the Ninth Age: The Dragon Age.",

        "description": "Overview\n\n￼Sony PlayStation 4\n\nThe PlayStation 4 is the fourth video game console produced by the Sony Corporation, and was released November 15th in North America and November 29th in Europe and Australia. It uses the x86 processor and 8GB of GDDR5 memory, making it much more PC-like (and easier to code for) than Sony's previous console, the PlayStation 3. It is capable of streaming games via Gaikai's streaming service, and features options such as gameplay video sharing, instant game resume from hibernation, a robust social network-like friends list, PS Vita integration & remote play, and background uploading and downloading. The new controller also gives players new input options via a touchpad and motion sensor light bar.\n\nFor the first time on a Sony console, a paid membership to their PlayStation Plus program will be required to play online multiplayer on the PS4. Free-to-play & subscription-based games are however exempt, as are other online services such as Netflix. A single PS+ membership applies across the PS Vita, PS3, and PS4 consoles.\n\nDuring Sony's Gamescom 2014 briefing, the company announced that as of August 10th 2014 they had sold 10 million PS4 units to consumers. On March 3, 2015 Sony revealed the console had surpassed 20 million PS4 units sold to consumers.\n\nAnnouncement\n\n￼\n\nSony officially announced the PlayStation 4 on February 20, 2013 at a 2 hour event called PlayStation Meeting 2013, which was hosted by Andrew House & held at the Hammerstein Ballroom in New York City.\n\nThe hardware specifications and interface of the new console were presented by Mark Cerny, who also showed off the newly redesigned DualShock 4 controller.\n\nGaikai CEO, David Perry, took the stage to talk about the potential their streaming and cloud gaming service can bring to the console.\n\nVarious developers then took the stage to show a few of the games & concepts being developed for the platform, including DriveClub, Killzone: Shadow Fall, Watch_Dogs, The Witness, and inFamous: Second Son. The console itself was not revealed at this event.\n\nLaunch Console & Software\n\n￼￼PlayStation 4 console\n\nThe public got its first look at the console on stage at Sony's press conference at E3 on June 10th, 2013, where it was revealed that it will cost $399 (US), contain a 500GB hard drive, and be packed with a controller and headset (ear bud + cord mic).\n\nOn August 20th 2013 at Gamescom in Germany, Sony revealed the console would be released November 15th 2013 in the US and November 29th in Europe.\n\nLaunch Software\n\nThe following games launched with the PS4:\n\nAngry Birds Star WarsAssassin's Creed IV: Black FlagBattlefield 4Blacklight: RetributionCall of Duty: GhostsContrastDC Universe OnlineEscape PlanFIFA 14flOwFlowerInjustice: Gods Among UsJust Dance 2014Killzone: Shadow FallKnackLEGO Marvel Super HeroesMadden NFL 25NBA 2K14NBA Live 14Need For Speed: RivalsPlayroomResogunSkylanders: Swap ForceSound ShapesSuper MotherloadSwitch Galaxy UltraTrine 2: The Complete StoryWarframe\n\nPS4 Apps\n\nThe PlayStation 4 launched with the following digital entertainment apps in North America:\n\nMusic UnlimitedVideo UnlimitedNetflixHuluAmazon Instant VideoCrackleCrunchyrollEPIXNBA Game TimeNHL GameCenterRedbox InstantVuduYuppTV\n\nDualShock 4 Controller\n\n￼￼Mark Cerny reveals the DualShock 4 during the PlayStation Meeting 2013.\n\nThe PlayStation 4 uses the DualShock 4 controller. It is similar to previous DualShock controllers at first glance, but it contains a few significant additions & alterations:\n\nTouch Pad - The center of the controller now features a touch pad in the center, capable of dual-touch input.Speaker & Headphone Jack - Below the touch pad is an external speaker for game sounds, and on the bottom of the controller is a headphone jack for headset communication.Light Bar - At the top of the controller is a color-changing light bar that is used in conjunction with the PlayStation 4 Eye to detect the movement & position of the player, very similar in function to the PlayStation Move controller.New Buttons - The hallmark \"Start\" & \"Select\" buttons that existed on every other PlayStation controller have been completely removed, with two new buttons flanking either side of the touch pad: Share button - To the left of the touch pad is the Share button, which allows players to upload gameplay screenshots & video with people on their friends list or on social media services.Options button - To the right of the touch pad is the Options button, which serves the function of the old Start button, for things like pausing the game and bringing up the in-game menus.Analog Sticks & Triggers Re-designed - The analog sticks are now concave, and the L2 & R2 buttons are more trigger-shaped, more similar to both the Dreamcast and Xbox 360 controllers.\n\nThe DualShock 4 is available in Jet Black during the launch of PlayStation 4, and in Wave Blue and Magma Red on November 29th for Europe and before the end of 2013 for North America\n\nGaikai Integration\n\nSony is leveraging its $380 million acquisition of the cloud service Gaikai in the PlayStation 4. Gaikai CEO Dave Perry announced that the service will be fully integrated with the new system to provide background downloading of games, streaming of game content, and potentially providing backwards compatibility with the PS1, PS2 and PS3 libraries in the future. A major feature will be the ability to play instant demos on the new system, without the need to download files locally. Upon further clarification with Shuhei Yoshida, president of Worldwide Studios of Sony Computer Entertainment, not all games on the system will contain this feature, but Sony is \"highly recommending\" implementation. In addition, the Share functionality of the PS4 is tied to Gaikai, allowing for players on the system to share their gameplay to social networks such as Facebook and Ustream.\n\nSony announced during their 2013 E3 press conference that the service would not be available at launch, but would be available sometime in 2014. The open beta for Playstation Now, the game streaming service powered by technology from Gaikai, began on July 31st 2014 in North America. It's only on the PS4 for now, but the company said it plans to later expand the service to other Sony gaming platforms.\n\nPlayStation 2 Emulation\n\nMonths before its official announcement at PlayStation Experience 2015 on Decemeber 4th, rumors of PS2 emulation for the PS4 begin to surface. On November 19th, Sony confirmed the existence of the PS2 emulation technology after the release of the PS4 Star Wars Battlefront bundles on November 17th, which came with four Star Wars games, three of which were PS2 games (Star Wars: Race Revenge, Star Wars: Jedi Starfighter, and Star Wars: Bounty Hunter.)\n\nEight games were released during it's initial launch for $9.99 or $14.99:\n\nGrand Theft Auto 3Grand Theft Auto: Vice CItyGrand Theft Auto: San AndreasDark CloudThe Mark of KriTwisted Metal: BlackWar of the MonstersRogue Galaxy\n\nThey are neither HD Remasters or PS2 Classics releases like on the PS3. Unlike HD remasters, they do not have physical retail releases, only digital. Even the Star Wars game that come with the Battlefront bundles are vouchers for digital codes. Also, these games run on emulation unlike HD Remasters which are ported to run natively on the PS3 hardware. However, unlike the PS2 Classics, these are up-scaled to 1080p, run at higher frame-rates, supports trophies as well as PS4 social and connectivity features such as Live Broadcast, Share Play, and Remote Play.\n\nHardware Specifications\n\nPDF released by SCEI on February 21, 2013 after announcing the consolePDF released by SCEI on June 10, 2013 following Sony's E3 press conference, with additional system specs\n\nMain Processor\n\nSingle-chip custom processor\n\nCPU: x86-64 AMD â€œJaguar,â€� 8 cores\n\nGPU: 1.84 TFLOPS, AMD next-generation Radeonâ„¢-based graphics engine\n\nMemoryGDDR5 8GB (Unified)Hard Disk Drive\n\n500 GB (Built-in, user-replaceable)\n\nExternal Dimensions\n\n275Ã—53Ã—305 mm (width Ã— height Ã— length) (tentative)\n\nOptical Drive\n\n(read only)\n\nBlu-ray 6xCAV\n\nDVD 8xCAV\n\nI/OSuper-Speed USB (USB 3.0) port x2, AUX port x1\n\nCommunication\n\nEthernet (10BASE-T, 100BASE-TX, 1000BASE-T)\n\nIEEE 802.11 b/g/n\n\nBluetoothÂ® 2.1 (EDR)\n\nAV output\n\nHDMI OUT port\n\nDIGITAL OUT (OPTICAL) port\n\nIncluded\n\nPlayStation 4 system x1\n\nWireless DUALSHOCK 4 controller x1\n\nMono headset x1\n\nAC power cord x1\n\nHDMI cable x1\n\nUSB cable x1\n\n",

        "description": "Overview\n\nIn terms of home video games, the PC is the oldest gaming platform still in use today, having an established library of tens of thousands of games. Chances are, you're probably reading this wiki on a PC right now. While there were various different personal computer platforms in the past (from manufacturers like NEC, Apple, Hitachi, Fujitsu, Commodore, Sharp, and Microsoft), the modern PC is largely descended from the IBM PC, which originally released in 1981 for $1561 (nearly $4000 in 2013 dollars).\n\nHistory\n\n￼An old IBM PC.\n\nThe first electronic computers were created between the 1930s and the 1940s. The first binary computer was the Z1 Computer, created by the German inventor Konrad Zuse. Other electronic computers would be created throughout the time period, including the ENIAC and the Harvard Mark I. Many of the first computers were used during World War II by both factions and would be later used for scientific research. Early computers were large enough to fill a room, making them unusable for practical, personal use. Later it would be used by banks and large businesses for economic calculations. Companies like IBM have supplied many businesses with computers years before the personal computer .\n\n1970s\n\nIt wasn't until the 1970s where computers usable for the average person were being made. Invented in 1970 by John V. Blakenbaker of the Kenbak Corporation, the Kenbak-1 is considered by the Computer History Museum to be the world's \"first personal computer\". Starting in 1971, it was sold for $750 and only 40 machines were ever built and sold. In 1973, Kenbak folded and stopped production. However, it was based on TTL (transistor-transistor-logic) discrete circuitry (much like the Magnavox Odyssey and Pong) rather than microprocessor technology. As such, it wasn't until the late 1970s that the first \"true\" personal computers began appearing.\n\nSeveral revolutionary inventions would later pave the way to the modern personal computer, most importantly the microprocessor. The project originated in 1969, when Japanese calculator manufacturer Busicom proposed the idea to American manufacturer Intel, and both soon collaborated to produce the first microprocessor. By 1971, Intel's engineers Bob Noyce and Gordon Moore, and Busicom's engineer Masatoshi Shima, succeeded in creating the world's first microprocessor, the 4-bit Intel 4004. The microprocessor helped in creating a more powerful central processing unit than the ones used in computers at the time and shrunk it so computers could be smaller. The microprocessor was the major invention that gave birth to the microcomputer, or the personal computer as it is known today.\n\nThe first microprocessor-based personal computer, i.e. the first microcomputer, was the SMP80/X, released by Sord (now Toshiba Personal Computer System Corporation) in 1974, utilizing the 8-bit Intel 8080 processor (its unreleased 1972 predecessor, the SMP80/08, used the first general-purpose microprocessor, the 8-bit Intel 8008). It was soon followed in 1975 by the Altair 8800, which also used the Intel 8080 as its CPU; since the computer's main language was binary code and only had an output of flashing lights, the computer was unusable by the common person. A similar microcomputer was released by NEC in 1976, the TK-80, which used the Intel 8080A.\n\nIt wasn't until 1977 when two California college students, Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak, created the first personal computer with a monitor, the Apple I. Thanks to the monitor, programming became much easier and programmers could see exactly what they were doing. Also, it helped the average user see the programs people created. This sparked a new revolution in the computer industry, bringing the creation of Apple Computers and starting the personal computer market. Other competing desktop computers with CRT display monitors soon followed in the late 1970s, including the M200 by Sord (now Toshiba Personal Computer System Corporation) in 1977, Hitachi's Basic Master in 1978, and Acorn's System 1 in 1979.\n\n1980s\n\n￼Powerful laptops have made PC gaming mobile.\n\nAfter the release of the Apple II, many competitors formed in the early 1980s, including the IBM Personal Computer, which would later dominate the market in the 1990s. The IBM PC was also one of the first 16-bit home computers, along with Mitsubishi's MULTI16 in 1981. Other leading competitors in the 1980s included Commodore, Atari and Amiga in Western markets, and NEC, Sharp and Fujitsu in Eastern markets. Due to the gaming crash of 1983, many computer manufacturers focused on the business aspects of these machines, leaving gaming as an afterthought.\n\nHowever, there were many computers that were well-known for their gaming libraries. The leading 8-bit gaming computer platforms in the 1980s included the Apple II in North America, the Commodore 64 and Atari 400/800 in the West, the ZX Spectrum and BBC Micro in the UK, the MSX in Japan and Europe, the high-resolution NEC PC-88 in Japan, and the high-colour FM-7 and Sharp X1 in Japan. The leading 16/32-bit gaming computers in the late 1980s to early 1990s were the NEC PC-98 in Japan, the Amiga and Atari ST in the West, the MS-DOS Compatible computers worldwide, and the more powerful (near arcade quality) Sharp X68000 and FM Towns computers in Japan. The best-selling computer models of the 20th century were the Commodore 64 (17 million units sold worldwide) and NEC PC-98 (over 18 million units sold in Japan). By the 1990s, companies like Origin Systems and EA became leading PC game developers.\n\nIn the mid-1980s, the graphical user interface was implemented on new PCs. Now it was easier for people to see what they were doing with computers thanks to computers like the Macintosh and the DOS extension Windows. The GUI was first created by Xerox in the 1960s, but the company was not interested in entering the computer market. Apple was given the rights to use GUI for the Macintosh, however, Microsoft was able to trick Apple into lending them prototype Macintosh computers to create programs for the new machines. They used the coding of the operating system to create Windows, an extension to DOS. Thanks to the cheap $100 price point and its compatibility with all DOS computers, Windows became a success, becoming the new standard of computers by the mid-1990s.\n\nThe 1980s also saw the emergence of portable laptop computers. The world's first laptop computer was the Epson HX-20 in 1981. The first commercially successful laptop was Kyocera's Kyotronic 85, originally released in 1983 and re-branded by Tandy as the TRS-80 Model 100, selling 6 million units worldwide. Other competitors soon followed, including Sharp's PC-5000 which had a touchpad pointing device in 1983, and Commodore's SX 64 in 1984. The first mass-market laptop was Toshiba's 16-bit T-1100 in 1985, which they followed with the T-3100 (the first with a built-in hard drive) in 1986. Other competitors soon followed, including NEC's PC-98 LT and IBM's PC Convertible in 1986 and Apple's Macintosh Portable in 1989. The first notebook computer was released in 1989, NEC's UltraLite, which they followed with the first colour TFT LCD laptop in 1990, the 32-bit PC-9801 NC. Apple soon followed with the PowerBook series from 1991 onwards, further popularizing laptop computers in the 1990s.\n\n1990s\n\nIn the 1990s, the Internet was released to the public after originally being used to connect college computers and military computers to different networks. Since the Internet was introduced to the public, it became a major part of modern society. Now the average computer user is able to access files from many different servers, and have the ability to communicate with people from around the world. This new technology was a revolution in gaming, with online gaming becoming a standard on the PC by the mid 1990s.\n\nAnother important revolution for PC gaming was the introduction of 3D graphics accelerator cards in the late 1990s, which allowed the PC to take the lead in cutting-edge 3D graphics technology by the 21st century. The first 3D graphics card for a home computer was NEC's PC-FXGA, released for their PC-98 platform in 1995, which could produce 3D graphics surpassing the PlayStation console and rivaling the Nintendo 64 in terms of polygon rendering performance. The first 3D graphics cards for IBM-compatible PC's soon followed in early 1996: Creative Labs' 3D Blaster, NVIDIA's NV1, and particularly NEC's PowerVR. While the 3D Blaster and NV1 (with the first game to support them being PlayStation port Toshinden) were unable to rival the PlayStation, the PowerVR surpassed the PlayStation and even approached arcade quality graphics, with a near arcade quality PowerVR demo of Namco's Rave Racer (though this PC port was later cancelled). Similarly, the NV1 card received PC ports of Sega titles Virtua Fighter Remix and Virtua Cop (which surpassed the Saturn versions, but couldn't rival the arcade originals). In late 1996, 3dfx launched the Voodoo line, which rivalled the PowerVR in quality and would soon become the most popular PC graphics cards of the late 1990s. Fujitsu soon introduced the FXG-1 \"Pinolite\" geometry processor, the first GPU with T&L (Transform & Lighting) hardware capabilities, in 1997, paving the way for NVIDIA's GeForce and ATI's Radeon, both of which would later dominate the PC graphics card market in the 21st century.\n\n21st century\n\nToday, more than a billion people around the world use the PC platform, with the majority of them being connected to the internet. A majority of PC gamers today are located in Asia, with China alone accounting for nearly a third of the worldwide PC gaming market, the growth of which has largely been fueled by the rise of online gaming.\n\nOperating Systems\n\nBefore operating systems, one had to learn complex coding in order to get something to work. With the creation of operating systems, computers became more accessible to the public.\n\nMicrosoft Windows\n\n￼￼Almost all PC games are designed for MS Windows.\n\nWindows was originally an extension to Microsoft's own coding system MS-DOS back in 1985. With Windows, people could easily browse through their files and do other simple functions much more quickly. Windows has grown in popularity and became the most popular OS in the world, having the support of PC makers like Dell, Gateway, and HP. Windows has gone through many iterations, starting with the MS-DOS days having Windows versions 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 3.1, and 3.11. Then came Windows NT 3.0-4.0 and Windows 2000 (oriented toward business) and the Windows 9x operating systems including Windows 95, 98, and ME (oriented toward home users). The 9x line was dropped and later versions of Windows have been based on NT, continuing the line from 2000 through XP, Vista, Windows 7, and now Windows 8.\n\nThe preferred platform for modern PC games is a Windows PC running either Windows XP, Vista, 7, or 8(.1). Windows XP does not support DirectX 10 but does not suffer from incompatibilities with older games like Vista, 7, or 8 may. Vista and 7 have the advantage of DirectX 10 or 11 while Windows 8.1 can support up to DirectX 11.2, and some exclusive games tied to the OS such as Halo 2. Because of the negative feedback that came from Vista, game developers were reluctant to make DirectX 10 only games. Thanks to the success of Windows 7, more DirectX 10/11 only games are being made, most notably Shattered Horizon, Just Cause 2, and Battlefield 3.\n\nWindows 7 provides gamers with a games browser that notifies the user of patches and updates for some games as they become available. Windows 7 is generally faster than Vista and fixes many of the issues people had with that OS such as intrusive Security settings and sluggish performance, Windows 7 also comes with DirectX 11. Dirt2 was among the first games to support this.\n\nOn October 25, 2012, Microsoft released Windows 8 to the public. This new operating system introduces the \"Metro\" interface, which makes menus more easily accessible to people who are using tablets and touch controls. Windows 8 also introduces its own app store which will allow developers to publish and distribute their Metro applications and games. Xbox Live is integrated with the OS which can be used as a user account for the computer and can earn achievement points on games downloaded from the app store. There have been complaints about the new OS because of its lackluster desktop interface and the removal of the standard Start menu in favor of the Metro interface, but Windows 8.1 addressed some of these issues with the return of the Start menu and the ability to use windowed Metro apps.\n\nOn July 29, 2015, Microsoft released Windows 10 to the public. It's a free update for all Windows 7 and 8 users for the first year of release, making it the first Windows OS that is available for free. One of the major features of Windows 10 is it's cross compatibility with tablets and smartphones as well as desktop and laptop PCs, as well as being implemented for Xbox One consoles in the future. It also features a new voice companion called Cortana, which is meant to compete with Apple's Siri. For gaming, Windows 10 introduces DirectX 12, which allows programmers to get better performance out of older graphics hardware with less oversight. Although current graphics cards can support some of the features of DirectX 12, fully-featured DX12 cards are not expected to release until 2016. The first game to support DX12 will be Fable Legends, which is releasing as a free-to-play title by the end of 2015. It also introduces further connections with the Xbox brand, where Microsoft will be selling games with the Xbox brand on the App Store as well as allow you to stream games from the Xbox One on all Windows 10 devices.\n\nMac OS\n\n￼￼Apple's Mac OS has a limited but growing game library.\n\nIn 1977, Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs made the Apple 1, Apple's first computer. They later gained popularity with the Apple II. In 1984, Apple released the Macintosh, which was the first Apple computer to have an operating system. The Mac OS lineup was born. Later, Apple switched to Unix-like coding, creating the Mac OS X lineup, which is still used in the new Apple computer lineup today.\n\nThe main issue with gaming on a Mac OS is that almost all earlier Mac PCs were not compatible with Windows based video games. More recently however with the creation of applications such as Boot Camp and Parallels more games are able to be run. The development of Intel based Macs also helps reduce this barrier by lifting some of the hardware restrictions.\n\nIn May 2010, Valve released Steam for Mac OS X, and ported all of their Source games to the Mac platform by the end of 2010. Valve is hoping for the expansion of Mac gaming in the near future.\n\nDuring the WDCC in 2014, Apple has announced their own graphics API, Metal. It allows game developers to use more hardware resources from devices using Mac OS X or iOS to gain better performance. This allows devices such as Macbooks and the iPad to run games with comparable performance to Windows PCs and consoles. Because of Metal, it was announced that Frostbite 3 is coming to Mac OS X and iOS, with its flagship title being Plants vs. Zombies: Garden Warfare.\n\nLinux\n\nLinux is a Unix-like OS licenced under the GPL. Unlike Windows and Mac OS, which require specific hardware for the OS to work properly, Linux is a software-based OS, which can be installed on a variety of devices, including devices which are not PC-based. Linux comes in various distributions, or \"distros,\" such as Ubuntu or Gentoo. Being an open source OS, the Linux community actively develops open source software, including games, for the Linux platform. However, there is no requirement that Linux software be open-source. You can get many Windows applications to work on Linux using specific Windows coding software for Linux (such as WINE) but it is generally not a preferable way of playing Windows games compared to running them in Windows on the same machine. Furthermore, WINE is not compatible with PowerPCs including PS3s with Linux installed. A popular option for overcoming Windows compatibility issues is to multi-boot the Linux distro with a version of Windows so that both operating systems are installed on the same PC at once and the user can switch between them.\n\nThere has been increased development for Linux games in recent years, with many indie games, such as Minecraft, releasing a Linux version. The Humble Indie Bundle typically includes Linux versions of games in addition to Mac and PC. Valve released the beta of their popular Steam platform for Linux (Starting with Ubuntu) in Nov. 2012 after their founder Gabe Newell expressed support for the platform. In 2013, Valve announced that they will be releasing their own Linux distro called SteamOS, which will be installed in all \"Steam Boxes\". It is a derivative of Ubuntu that has an interface similar to Big Picture Mode that can be navigated using a controller. It allows users to stream games from another PC so users can run games that are currently not compatible with Linux. However, support for Linux gaming has been growing over the years, with many games, including indie and AAA titles, having Linux versions being released at launch.\n\nThe most popular Linux-based OS on the market right now is Android. It is a growing, open source mobile operating system with a growing gaming library. However, it is important to note that most Linux-PC applications are incompatible with Android and vice-verse (without a significant amount of effort).\n\nComponents of a PC\n\nThere are many replaceable parts in a PC, which is a main aspect separating them from consoles. PCs may be upgraded and maintained as time passes to keep up with the latest games, and a user's configuration will affect which games they can play. The main parts of a computer are as follows:\n\nCPU (Central Processing Unit) - The processing unit that executes operations in a computer. It consists of an integrated circuit built of many transistors that runs on binary code. The CPU communicates with the rest of the computer through the Northbridge via a front side bus. Most medium and high end processors are 64-bit and have several cores which is known as parallel processing. The CPU creates a lot of heat and as a result requires its own dedicated heatsink or waterblock even on a low end computer.GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) - The dedicated graphics rendering device, very important for games. The GPU generally has its own circuit board which is slotted into the motherboard, the processing unit its self is also made up of many transistors and is heavily based on parallel processing. The GPU also uses its own dedicated RAM for storing texture data to be processed. Current generation GPUs are capable of rendering shader model 4.1 processes as part of the DirectX 11 package. Many graphics cards are also compatible with OpenGL.Motherboard - The main circuit board in a PC that all the components connect to. Its through this board that all other components may communicate between each other and is run by a set of North and South bridge chipsets, though newer CPUs actually include an integrated nothrbridge.RAM (Random Access Memory) - Volatile dynamic memory of a system. Data can be temporarily loaded here to be accessed much faster than from the hard drive or even a solid state drive so not to slow the calculations made by the CPU. The current standard is DDR3.PSU (Power Supply Unit) - Supplies power to the PC. Needs to have high enough power (measured in Watts) to run all the components in the system under high load.HDD (Hard Disk Drive) - The main storage device of a PC.SSD (Solid State Drive) - A type of storage similar to a hard drive, but contain no moving parts. Because of this, data stored in solid state drives can be accessed and written quicker than hard drives.Sound Card - An expansion card that processes audio on a separate chip. Most motherboards provide integrated sound chips making sound cards an optional upgrade.ODD (Optical Disc Drive) - The peripheral device that reads optical discs such as DVDs, BDs, and CDs.Case - Houses the components.Monitor - The visual display unit of a computer.Input Devices - Mouse, keyboard, microphone, etc. Because of the uptake of the Xbox 360 most games from 2005 onward will work with the Xbox 360 controller. This is also helped by the fact that the Xbox 360 has a USB connection that allows game developers to easily port the control system from current console games to the PC. In 2014, Microsoft released drivers that allowed Xbox One controllers to work for all 360 controller-compatible games.Cooling - Commonly either water or air based. With standard cooling devices the lowest possible temperature is the ambient temperature, that of the room the system resides in. To further lower the temperature elaborate devices such as Peltier coolers, liquid gases or phase cooling may be installed, though this is best left to the extreme enthusiast due to the risk of most of these options.\n\nGraphic Settings\n\nUnlike their console equivalents most PC games have the ability to vary the graphical settings. This feature is inherent to PCs as few systems bear the same hardware and so the user must tailor the game's settings for optimal performance and visual quality. With modern hardware PCs can often surpass their console counterparts in terms of technical graphics. Recent titles offer the option to set the ideal configuration of a game automatically. Such settings include:\n\nResolution - The number of pixels along the x and y axes to which the game will render.Anti-Aliasing - Raises the quality of the edges of polygon based models using smoothing algorithms.Anisotropic Filtering - Raises the quality of textures viewed from obtuse angles.Texture Quality - General resolution of the paint scheme of each model.Model Quality - General number of polygons used for each model.High Dynamic Range lighting - Allows for dynamic tone mapping in games.Shader Model - Technology a game can use to render advanced visual effects.Vsync - Reduces an artifact known as tearing by synchronizing the frame rate and refresh rate of the monitor.\n\nGame Lineup\n\nEarly History\n\n￼￼Blizzard is one of the most prominent PC developers.\n\nComputers first featured simple titles similar to SpaceWar! or simple text-input games such as Adventure but have since evolved to become the leading platform for cutting-edge game development in the 21st century due to their seemingly limitless potential.\n\nOld computers such as the Commodore 64 and NEC PC-98 featured a built-in controller port, for C64 controllers as well as Atari 2600 and other controllers. Many games supported both keyboard and joystick input. Since mice have become standard, they have become the preferable method of input for many games, with various manufacturers branding mice specifically for gaming. Joysticks are still widely used via USB. Early games were simply saved onto floppy disks by a publisher or even the programmer themselves. These disks were sold in Ziploc bags and Vinyl slips; they generally had a bland manual and had nowhere near the shelf-presentation of a modern game. Modern games are distributed mainly on optical discs in hard plastic cases or cardboard boxes. There has been a large surge in digital distribution as well.\n\nEvolution in the 1990s\n\nIn the early days of computer gaming, most games were developed by a single programmer, and were often simple text adventures or downgraded ports/clones of more powerful arcade games. PC gaming has since evolved to encompass a wide variety of genres, some faring better than others.\n\nThe most popular genres that have evolved on the platform are the CRPG (Computer Role-Playing Game), RTS (Real-Time Strategy), and FPS (First-Person Shooter).\n\nCRPG's were largely inspired by pen & paper role playing games such as Dungeons & Dragons. The genre spans early ASCII adventures such as Rogue, action RPG's such as Dragon Slayer and Diablo, and MMORPGs (Massively Multiplayer Online RPGs) such as Lineage and World of Warcraft. Freedom is a main element that has evolved with CRPG's. The earlier games were more linear in their approach, sometimes even approaching level design from a distinct \"stages\" standpoint. CRPGs evolved to have 3D dungeons, real time combat, and huge multiplayer, non-linear worlds.\n\nReal-Time Strategy games, such as Starcraft and Command & Conquer, is a genre that was at the heart of PC gaming in the 1990s and continues to remain a dominant PC genre in Asian countries like South Korea and China. The genre requires fast-paced clicking using a mouse, making implementation on consoles very difficult; ironically, the game often considered the first RTS, Herzog Zwei, was a Sega Mega Drive / Genesis console game. The genre has certainly seen evolution, but the premise of collecting resources, spawning an army, and sending it into battle, has remained relatively constant throughout RTS history. Today, the most popular RTS games are called MOBAs (Multiplayer Online Battle Arenas), with games such as League of Legends and DOTA 2 being some of the most played games in the world.\n\n￼￼Steam comprises over 70% of the digital distribution market.\n\nThe third, and arguably most popular, PC genre is the FPS. After being popularized with iD Software's Wolfenstein 3D, the genre exploded into popularity with Doom. The use of mouse a mouse to look around was later popularized by Duke Nukem 3D and Quake. It's a genre that has been ported to consoles, but still controls better on PC due to quick, precise aiming with mice. Landmark PC FPS games include Doom, Quake, Counter-Strike, and Half-Life.\n\nThe PC game industry has seen a steady push towards consoles for many years now, due to low sales numbers. These sales are often attributed to illegal downloading as well as the cost of upgrading one's system. The PC industry is largely kept alive by the convenience of having many games at ones fingertips on a PC as well as the superiority of certain genres on the platform.\n\nHowever, PC gaming has seen a massive resurgence of popularity within the last few years thanks to the growing popularity of Steam, the massive success of indie titles such as Minecraft and DayZ, and the rise of eSports with games such as League of Legends, DOTA 2, and Counter Strike: Global Offensive.\n\nDigital Distribution\n\nHowever, even with retail PC game sales slowing, digital distribution has been expanding within the last few years. Popular digital distribution services like Valve's Steam, EA's Origin, and Desura helped in boosting the sales of PC games and have helped in making many indie games popular. Other digital distributors, like GOG, sell older PC games that either don't sell in retail anymore or are too old to be compatible with newer operating systems. These services allow you to play older games and usually sell them for less than $10 while also being free of DRM. The Humble Indie Bundle and other alternatives have been a great resource in downloading numerous indie and retail games for prices set by the end user. The majority of the proceeds go to the game developers as well as numerous charities. These type of services help in having an easy way to play PC games and having developers keep in touch with their communities.\n\nIssues\n\nUpgrading\n\n￼￼NVidia's popular GeForce series of GPUs.\n\nA primary issue with PC gaming is the barrier to entry due to cost. Pricing of a PC depends on what type of performance a user wants when it comes to playing games, but for people who want to play games at maximum settings, it can cost at least $1000 to build and up to $3000 to buy from a manufacturer. In order to play some of the biggest, most graphically impressive games on PC at maximum settings with a stable framerate, it may require a user to upgrade their computer components every 2-3 years. However, thanks to better optimization of games and the creation of lower level APIs such as AMD's Mantle, the barrier of entry for PC gaming has been decreasing and lower-end hardware can be used to run games with decent performance.\n\nThe ability to selectively upgrade hardware also gives PC gamers a flexibility absent in console gaming. Users can upgrade RAM, GPU or hard drives to make their computers more powerful as the games become more demanding. In turn, this flexibility and constant increase in performance allows developers to create games that can fully utilize the latest hardware, often leading to more complex or better looking games.\n\nPiracy and Digital Rights Management\n\nOne huge problem reported by publishers with PC gaming is the excessive piracy of games. Bootleg copies of games have been a problem since the introduction of the personal computer. Many computer experts were able to copy floppy disks and distribute them to either share with friends or profit off them. Since the introduction of the internet, it has been easier to distribute pirated software than ever before (including games). Bittorrent sites make it easier for people to put up game files where everyone can download and play.\n\nAlthough piracy ranges across the world, the areas with the most piracy are developing nations. These are areas that either have poor game distribution or have gamers that are too poor to afford many games. Piracy has also gone up since the economic crash of 2008.\n\nThere are many measures that game publishers use in attempts to prevent piracy. Floppy disk games of the 1980's included items in their game boxes called \"feelies\", or items necessary to have in order to play the game. Some games required the player to look in the instruction manual and type in a specific word to play the game while others had the player decrypt a code displayed on a screen using one of the items in the box. As CD games became more popular and CD copiers were gaining traction, CD keys, unique codes to identify legitimately purchased games, were introduced. Sometimes CD keys are used to access certain parts of a game such as multiplayer and Live features in Games for Windows Live games. There have been many issues with CD keys. If you were to lose your CD key and needed to reinstall a game, you had to buy your game again. This type of security did not last long because pirates were finding ways to create fake CD keys that they could use to play pirated games. Digital Distribution has made CD keys mostly obsolete.\n\nThis led game publishers and various third parties to develop forms of Digital Rights Management (DRM). DRM is digtal software protection that prevents the user from using copied game discs and downloaded disc images or installing games on multiple machines. Some early forms of DRM may interfere with some applications such as disc drive emulation software used for mounting disc images.\n\n￼￼Activation failure screen for GTA IV.\n\nThere have been controversial uses of DRM within the last few years. In 2008, EA announced that they are going to use a new version of SecuROM DRM that limits the number of simultaneous activated installs for all of their new PC games (starting with Mass Effect and Spore). Since then there has been a huge controversy over DRM, even questioning the legality of it.\n\nIn 2009, Ubisoft introduced a new DRM that will require you to be online at all times when playing a game. If you are disconnected from the internet for any reason, gameplay will stop. The first games to utilize the new DRM were Assassin's Creed II and Silent Hunter 5. As of 2011, Ubisoft decided to discontinue and retool their online DRM system with the release of Assassin's Creed Brotherhood, and was relaunched with the release of Driver: San Francisco. Today, Ubisoft has their own digital platform, Uplay, that is needed to access many of their games.\n\nCommon complaints about this type of DRM are losing game progress and not being able to play when an internet connection is unavailable. Other companies are using similar DRM including EA with Command and Conquer 4 and Blizzard with StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty and Diablo III. Both C&C4 and D3 require a constant, active connection to the host servers, but Blizzard's implementation in SC2 allows offline play of the single player campaign and AI versus modes with achievement functionality disabled.\n\nMany digital distributors feature their own DRM. Steam requires users to connect to their servers at least once and enable offline mode before playing games offline. In Steam's offline mode, achievements are deactivated. Microsoft's Games For Windows Live has similar restrictions.\n\n",

It was founded in 2013 by the ex-videogame journalist Mauro Fanelli and the graphic designer Andrea Gellato. After working together for more than a year in their spare time on their first (and still unreleased) project, they decided it was the right move to go indie and work full time on their games.",

Since then Nippon Ichi Software, Inc. has grown into an international company focused on creating video game products across modern console platforms. NIS America, Inc. subsidiary of Nippon Ichi Software, Inc. of Japan, established its North American operations on December 24, 2003. Based in Santa Ana, California, NIS America, Inc. handles operations including localization, marketing, and publishing of Nippon Ichi titles. The first game to be released in North America by NIS America was Phantom Brave.\n\nNIS America was the result of the company's wish to focus on international publication of their works in the U.S., given the increased popularity of their titles. Prior to the creation of this subsidiary, NIS software titles that appeared in the U.S. were localized and distributed by outside publishers. Notable examples would be Disgaea: Hour of Darkness, published in North America by Atlus and in Europe by Koei, La Pucelle, published in North America by Mastiff Inc, and Rhapsody: A Musical Adventure which was also published in North America by Atlus. The publisher has become a somewhat of a well-known presence in the North American market, having won RPGLand's \"Stateside Publisher of the Year Award\" in 2009.",

        "description": "Founded in 1993 by James Schmalz, Digital Extremes Ltd. proudly ranks as one of the world's top development studios in the interactive entertainment industry.\nHeadquartered in London Ontario, Canada’s 10th largest city, Digital Extremes got its foothold early on in the game industry during the shareware craze of the early 90s. Epic Pinball was a ten month project written entirely in assembly language by Schmalz that went on to become one of the most successful shareware games ever made, trailing only behind such industry greats as Duke3D, Doom and Wolfenstein 3D. Sequels such as Silverball and Extreme Pinball were released shortly thereafter and together they helped fund the creation of what would become one of the industry’s blockbuster franchises, Epic Games’ Unreal®.\n\nBeginning in 1994, Digital Extremes partnered with Epic Games (at that time, its shareware publisher) and co-created Unreal and its counterpart Unreal Tournament. Both games set new standards for first-person action games and broke new ground in online multiplayer gaming. Tremendously rich graphics, fine-tuned gameplay, frenetic action and high quality production value are descriptions that have become synonymous with any Unreal branded game. To date, the award-winning Unreal franchise, including Unreal, Unreal Tournament and Unreal Championship has sold more than 12 million units worldwide across the PC, PlayStation®2, Xbox™ and Dreamcast™ platforms.\n\nDigital Extremes completed development on its original IP for the current generation of consoles, Dark Sector®, which shipped to stores in 2008, using its proprietary next-gen technology, the Evolution Engine™. Following its success, the studio expanded to two teams to allow for simultaneous development on separate projects.\n\nDigital Extremes completed work on the Multiplayer component of 2K Games’ blockbuster, Bioshock® 2 as well as the PC version of THQ hit, Homefront™.  The company also recently ventured into the mobile world with the release of Retro Pinball for Apple’s iOS platform, a throwback to the company’s roots.  More recently, Digital Extremes earned critical acclaim for the development of first-person action game, The Darkness® II, based on the comic book series of the same name.  In addition, the company assisted Microsoft with additional multiplayer content to Halo®4.  The studio is currently developing and publishing the Free-to-Play action game, Warframe",

To date, their most popular franchise is the critically acclaimed Hitman series. IO Interactive remained a subsidiary of Square Enix until 2017, when its parent started seeking buyers for the studio. IO Interactive completed a management buyout, regaining their independent status and retaining the rights for Hitman and Freedom Fighters, in June 2017. \n \n- \n \nFormerly called \nASX Nr. 14.811 ApS (1990–1991) \nMermaid Invest ApS (1991–1998) \nIO Interactive ApS (1998–2000) \n \nParent company \nSquare Enix (2003–2017) \n- \n \nIt’s simple. Io-Interactive is here to deliver exciting world class entertainment, and we want our games to play and feel like the people who created them. It is our way of making sure that we will always deliver something unique and interesting. This requires not only lots of work but also lots of guts, talented people and a great working environment and we do our utmost to have all of this. \n \nWe’re doing as much as we can to make IOI feel like a second home. We meet in the morning and share breakfast, eat lunch together and party together. On Fridays we sometimes have our Friday bar – either planned as a big thing where we run around in the building with laser guns – or just spontaneously started somewhere in the building. Every now and then we have IOI days where we can dig into our pet projects or attend presentations from colleagues or external experts on everything game related. \n \nAround Christmas, we usually have the house full of all our kids making ginger bread houses and paper cuttings. In the summertime there are often football games going on and besides these three cornerstones of Denmark (food, beer and football) there’s a thing like the monthly board game night where we just go totally analogue. \n \n~ IO Interactive",

        "description": "11 bit studios, based in Warsaw, Poland, is a multiplatform game development studio selling games worldwide. Our titles have received multiple prestigeous awards throughout the years including: Apple Design Award, Best of PAX and IGN Editor's Choice. \n \n- \n \nIt all started in 2009, when a bunch of veterans of polish gaming industry joined their forces and founded 11 bit studios. They gathered few talented people and got to work. After a year our first child was born – Anomaly Warzone Earth hit the stores. Quickly it became a huge success, with great sales and number of industry awards, including Apple Design Award. \n \nIt was a proof that we were on the right track and in the next few years we repeated the success with Anomaly 2, Anomaly Korea and few other games. But you know what they say – the more you have, the more you want so in 2012 we decided it was time for something bigger. \n \nFor the next two years we worked on our upcoming title. Bigger and better than ever before, but what’s even more important – a game that had a potential to touch people. A game that could matter. Something, that hasn’t been done before. A thing to be played and discussed for years to come. In the end of 2014 we were ready and our greatest achievement to this day had it’s premiere. On 14th of November This War of Mine had its release and everything had changed. \n \nThe cost of development were covered in first weekend after the premiere, and since then the game keeps being one of the topsellers on Steam and other distribution platforms. The game got over 100 awards and was covered as a phenomenon in the biggest magazines and newspapers all around the world including TIME, EDGE, Washington Post and more. \n \nThis brings us to the place where we are today. This War of Mine is still selling really well, being one of the most successful indie titles of the last decade. Our next big game, Frostpunk, is right around the corner and you know what? Again our guts are telling us it will leave a mark. We are crossing the borders and redefining the rules of the genre and that’s the road we want to follow. We believe in creating things instead of just copying them. \n \nSoon you’ll tell us if we achieved what we hoped for. In the meantime we are not slacking around – we started a publishing program that allows developers from all around the world to release their indie games with our help. The first games are already out there, so you should check them out. \n \nThat’s our story so far, but we are quite sure there is more to come. \n \n~ 11 bit studios",

Thanks to the digital publishing revolution we are able to fund our own ideas and create games that we really want to make, without any outside interference. \n \nOur biggest hit so far was Zombie Driver with it's console remake Zombie Driver HD which we self-published on the PC, Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, Android and Xbox One. The next upcoming game is titled X-Morph: Defense and will be available for PC, Xbox One and PlayStation 4 in 2017. Before X-Morph: Defense and Zombie Driver we worked on a multiplayer car combat game called D.I.P.R.I.P. which was released in 2008 on Steam as one of the first Source Engine mods on the platform.",

We build ourselves a name with creative story telling, intelligent puzzles and heartwarming humor. Adventures are our roots but we soon moved into the RPG genre. \n \nWith Venetica we paid the genre a first visit and with Lords of the Fallen and The Surge we made ourselves a name on the international stage. \n \n \nIn June 2020 it was announced that Focus Home Interactive had acquired Deck13 Interactive.",

        "description": "History\n\n￼Founders of Blizzard (Left to Right): Pearce, Morhaime and Adham\n\nBlizzard Entertainment was founded by Allen Adham, Michael Morhaime and Frank Pearce on February 1991. After graduating from UCLA a year before, the three computing graduates decided to form a gaming company called Silicon & Synapse, which referred to the building block of the computer (silicon) and the human mind (synapse).\n\nUnder that name, the company developed games for the Super NES like Rock n' Roll Racing, The Lost Vikings and Blackthorne. Silicon & Synapse garnered many awards within those years but received backlash for its company name. Many mistook it to be a breast implant firm because of the word \"silicon,\" which led them to briefly changed its name to Chaos Studios but it did not help either. Many people had trouble pronouncing the name (mispronunciations ranged from \"chows\" to \"Chads\") and discovered that another company with the Chaos name already existed.\n\nIn early 1994 they were acquired by distributor Davidson & Associates for $6.75 million. The same year the three year old gaming company switched its name to Ogre Studios but Davidson & Associates went against it because they felt \"ogre\" was too scary for the target audience. Finally, after numerous discussions within the team, they finally settled on Blizzard Entertainment.\n\nOverview\n\nBlizzard's three main intellectual properties include the Warcraft, StarCraft, and Diablo franchises. Each franchise boasts an impressive, and almost \"cult-like\" following of fans, that have made Blizzard one of the most easily recognizable names in the gaming industry today.\n\nIn July 2008 Vivendi Games, who at the time owned Blizzard Entertainment, merged with game publisher Activision. Using Blizzard's name as a marketing tool to promote the company and deal as a merger and not a direct buyout, named the resulting company Activision Blizzard.\n\nConventions\n\n￼A \"Murky\" pet that was given away to attendees of the first Blizzcon in 2005.\n\nIt is due to this incredible community that has developed around these three unique IPs and the unprecedented success of their hit titles like StarCraft and World of Warcraft that Blizzard is able to host it's own convention's; namely BlizzCon and the Worldwide Invitational (or WWI). These conventions boast a number of incredible events such as tournaments for Warcraft 3, StarCraft, Hearthstone and World of Warcraft arena tournaments, costume and machinima contests, as well as major announcements concerning their three flagship franchises.\n\nThe first BlizzCon was held in Anaheim, California at the Anaheim Convention Center in 2005 and has since been held on a semi-regular basis. It has been held since in 2007, 2008, and 2009. In July 2008, Blizzard announced they would be partnering with DirectTV to televise BlizzCon 2008.The third Worldwide Invitational was held in May 2007 in Seoul, Korea and featured the unveiling of the highly anticipated StarCraft II. The fourth WWI was held in Paris, France in June 2008 with the announcement of Diablo III and information concerning the second expansion to their massive multiplayer online RPG World of Warcraft, The Wrath of the Lich King. Previous WWI events were held in Seoul, Korea and featured professional, or \"eSports\" tournaments but no new product announcements.On top of the many prizes and tournaments going on, Blizzard has also made a habit out of giving away special codes that can be redeemed in World of Warcraft for different aesthetic purposes. Things such as in-game pets that follow a player around, or a suit that dresses them up are just a few things that Blizzard has given away exclusively at their events.Blizzard has announced and is holding the next Blizzcon in August of 2009. The convention will, as the previous Blizzcon of 2008, be available to non-attendee's through DirectTV for a nominal fee. It will also be available for purchase to be viewed via a streaming feed online.Blizzard has announced that BlizzCon 2010 is scheduled for October 2010 at the Anaheim Convention Center.Blizzard canceled BlizzCon 2012, in order to have more time to work on their current projects.\n\nBattle.net\n\nIn 1997 Blizzard released an online gaming service called Battle.net that allows players from around the world to play together for free. This service has been implemented into most of Blizzard's titles. Battle.net has an array of functions including a matchmaking service and custom gameplay support that allows players to create their own maps and game types to share and play online. One such game type called Defense of the Ancients (or DoTA) in WarCraft 3 has since grown to become somewhat of a phenomenon similar to the original Counter-Strike mod for Half-Life.\n\nWith the release of StarCraft II, Blizzard announced that an all new Battle.net service titled Battle.net 2.0 will launch concurrently with the game. Battle.net 2.0 features cross game features with all upcoming Blizzard Entertainment games, including backwards compatibility with World of WarCraft. In 2009, Blizzard required all World of Warcraft accounts be changed into battle.net accounts to prepare for the service.\n\nGames of Blizzard\n\nAs Silicon & Synapse\n\nRPM Racing (1991)The Lost Vikings (1992)Rock N' Roll Racing (1993)\n\nAs Blizzard Entertainment\n\nBlackthorne (1994)The Death and Return of Superman (1994)Warcraft: Orcs & Humans (1994)Justice League Task Force (1995)Warcraft II: Tides of Darkness (1995)Warcraft II: Beyond the Dark Portal (1996)Diablo (1996)The Lost Vikings II (1997)StarCraft (1998)StarCraft: Brood War (1998)Diablo II (2000)Diablo II: Lord of Destruction (2001)Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos (2002)Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne (2003)World of Warcraft (2004)World of Warcraft: The Burning Crusade (2007)World of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King (2008)StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty (2010)World of Warcraft: Cataclysm (2010)Diablo III (2012)World of Warcraft: Mists of Pandaria (2012)StarCraft II: Heart of the Swarm (2013)Hearthstone: Heroes of Warcraft (2014)Diablo III: Reaper of Souls (2014)World of Warcraft: Warlords of Draenor (2014)Heroes of the Storm (2015)StarCraft II: Legacy of the Void (2015)\n\nGames In Development or Rumored\n\nOverwatch (\"Spring\" 2016)World of Warcraft: Legion (\"Summer\" 2016)\n\nGames Cancelled\n\nWarcraft Adventures: Lord of the ClansStarCraft GhostTitan\n\nFeature Films\n\nWarcraft\n\nWarcraft - June 10, 2016\n\nKey Figures\n\nMichael Morhaime - President and co-founder (1991 - present)Frank Pearce Jr. - Senior Vice President and co-founder (1991 - present)Sam Didier - Art Director (1992 - present)Joeyray Hall - DVD/ Video Production Supervisor (1992 - present)Bob Fitch - Lead Software Engineer (1993 - present)Nick Carpenter - Executive Art Director (1994 - present)Shane Dabiri - Lead Producer (1994 - present)Matt Samia - Vice-President/ Cinematics & Media (1995 - present)Paul W.

Blizzard threatened legal action and filed a lawsuit against the developers which eventually caused the service to shut down.The three viking characters (Erik the Swift, Baleog the Fierce, and Olaf the Stout) from Blizzard's game \"The Lost Vikings\" can be found in their MMORPG World of Warcraft in the Uldaman dungeon camping in a side tunnel off of the main zone.Notable title cancellations from Blizzard include Warcraft Adventures: Lord of the Clans which was cancelled in 1998, Shattered Nations, StarCraft: Ghost which was \"indefinetely postponed\" in 2006; and Titan which was cancelled in 2014 after seven years of development, however the \"combat\" portions of the game became what is now Overwatch.Blizzard was honored in 2008 at the 59th Annual Technology & Enginerring Emmy Awards for the creation of World of Warcraft. The award was accepted by Michael Morhaime.It has been announced by Blizzard that they will be producing a live-action Warcraft movie to be released by Legendary Pictures. The film will be released to theaters June 10, 2016.Blizzard was originally to be the company to publish Pax Imperia II but the project was dropped when it was decided that it would be in conflict with their other space-based RTS StarCraft. THQ eventually struck a deal with Heliotrope to have the game published under the title Pax Imperia: Eminent Domain.",

        "description": "The first game to be released by \"On-Line-Systems\" was Mystery House in 1980. The game was based on a concept penned by Roberta Williams, she was inspired after playing text-only adventure games and considered the possibility of blending solid game design with a on-screen representations of the game world. Roberta's husband Ken Williams, at the time a programmer for IBM, took on the task of creating a home computer game based on his wife's concepts. The formula and balance between graphic representation of the game world and the user interface at the bottom of the screen would be the prevalent form of adventure games for years to come.\n\nFollowing the success and the company's relocation to Oakhurst, California in 1982, the name was changed to \"Sierra On-line systems\", a nod to the Sierra Nevada Hills where the new headquarters were to be located. Over the next few years, Sierra On-Line Systems released an impressive array of highly successful and influential adventure games including the legendary King's Quest Series. Other successful series and franchises developed and/or published by Sierra On-Line Systems were Gabriel Knight , Space Quest, Leisure Suit Larry. Sierra also released a few stand-alone adventures, such as The Black Cauldron (based on the Disney picture) and The Wizard and the Princess. Despite releasing games of other genres as well, such as Caesar and Lords of the Realm, Sierra's name became synonymous with engaging and quirky adventure gaming.\n\nAcquisitions of small independent developers further broadened the catalogue and range of Sierra products. Dynamix was acquired in 1990 and released critically acclaimed war simulations as well as the evergreen The Incredible Machine which has seen many sequels and reincarnations on many platforms since. Further companies bought by Sierra included Coktel Vision ( Gobliiins), Impression Games ( Caesar Series, High Seas Trader), Papyrus Design Group, SubLogic, Bright Star Technologies and Berkeley Systems ( You Don't know Jack). Sierra also looked to expand its home productivity lines; the acquisition of Green Thumb Software, Print Design and Aria Software expanded Sierra's catalogue by print machines, home gardening products and culinary books series respectively.\n\n1995 was a year of ambition and success for Sierra. Earnings improved by almost 20 % and the software released by Sierra included highly anticipated Phantasmagoria which received mixed reviews but sold rather well and has since gained a cult status, although it is quite hard to track down original copies. Furthermore, Sierra released The Realm Online, one of the first MMORPG to be released for the home computer and is still played to this day.\n\nBeginning in 1996, Sierra went through a series of acquisitions and changes of parent companies including CUC, Cendant Software and Havas Interactive, which is a subsidiary of Vivendi Universal.\n\nIn 2002 Sierra was renamed Sierra Entertainment. The next few years proved to be difficult and the titles they released found only minor success (Homeworld 2) if any at all. Some games, such as the rebirth of the Leisure Suit Larry Series (without it's creator Al Lowe on Board) were torn apart by critics and sold poorly. In 2008 Vivendi Games merged with Activision to became the Activision Blizzard company.\n\nWith Vivendi Games ceasing to exist, the Sierra brand became the property of Activision for possible future reanimation or sale. Activision exercised that option in August 2014, reviving the Sierra name as a small publishing label for both revived Sierra properties and newer concepts, as well. The first two games announced by this new incarnation of Sierra are a new King's Quest game and Geometry Wars 3.\n\nThe company logo displays an image of Half Dome, one of the most noticeable landmarks in Yosemite National Park, which is only miles from the company's longtime home of Oakhurst.\n\n",

        "description": "History\n\nActivision was originally founded on October 1, 1979 and became the first independent developer and distributor of video games with its first games developed for the Atari 2600. Activision was founded by former music industry executive Jim Levy along with former Atari programmers David Crane, Larry Kaplan, Alan Miller, and Bob Whitehead. Activision's first game release came in the form of Dragster in 1980, with their first big hit being Pitfall! in 1982. Pitfall! quickly became one of best selling Atari 2600 games ever selling over 4 million copies.\n\nOn June 13, 1986, Activision merged with Infocom due to Jim Levy being a big fan of the company and did not want to see them fall. Six months later, Bruce Davis, who was heavily against the merger, became CEO of Activision. In 1989, the Infocom studios were finally closed by Activision putting 21 out of 26 employees out of business.\n\nIn 1988, Activision moved on to produce more software outside of the video game industry and changed its corporate name to Mediagenic. Activision continued to develop video games, however, for many platforms including the NES, Sega Master System, Atari 7800, Atari ST, Commodore 64, and Amiga.\n\nIn the following years, Mediagenic had multiple financial issues including patent infringement suits and eventually was taken over by Robert Kotick, an investor group lead. The company eventually filed for Chapter 11 reorganization and merged with The Disc Company. Mediagenic started to rise out of bankruptcy, made some strategic acquisitions, and changed its name back to Activision in December 1992. Activision also moved its headquarters from Mountain View in the Silicon Valley to Santa Monica, CA deciding as well to produce only video games from that point on.\n\nIn 1991, Activision released The Lost Treasures of Infocom which was a package of 20 Infocom games on one disc. A year later, Activision released another 11 games in The Lost Treasures of Infocom II.\n\nAcquisitions & Partnerships\n\n1997\n\nPartnership with Raven Software.Acquired CentreSoft, Ltd.Acquired NBG Distribution.\n\n1998\n\nFounded Pandemic Studios.Partnership with Marvel Entertainment.Partnership with Head Game Publishing.Partnership with Disney Interactive.Partnership with LucasArts Entertainment.Partnership with CD Contact Data.\n\n1999\n\nAcquired Neversoft.Acquired Expert Software.\n\n2000\n\nAcquired Gray Matter Interactive.\n\n2001\n\nAcquired Treyarch.\n\n2002\n\nAcquired Z-Axis, Ltd.Acquired Luxoflux Corporation.\n\n2003\n\nPartnership with DreamWorks SKG.Partnership with Valve.Partnership with Shaba Games, LLC.Partnership with Sega.Acquired Infinity Ward.\n\n2005\n\nAcquired Vicarious Visions.Acquired Toys For Bob.Acquired Beenox.\n\n2006\n\nAcquired RedOctane.\n\n2007\n\nPartnership with MGM Interactive.Acquired Bizarre Creations.Acquired Demonware.\n\n2008\n\nGiant merger with Vivendi to become Activision Blizzard.\n\n2010\n\n10 Year Partnership with Bungie.\n\nCriticism\n\nActivision has been criticized for forcing developers to release games in popular franchises on a yearly basis. Examples include the Call Of Duty franchise, Guitar Hero franchise, and Tony Hawk franchise. Due to the limited time frame, developers often cannot alter the gameplay or other features significantly, thus releasing a game every year that is usually pretty similar to the one that came before it.\n\nIn a recent interview with Game Informer, the studio head of Treyarch was asked what game he would like to develop next. He responded by saying that he isn't the one to make that decision, showing that even the heads of studios under Activision cannot escape the company's grasp.\n\n",

Then in March 2013 Kaga upped this to a complete acquisition, due to a desire to reform CyberFront's management to increase profitability. However on December 19, 2013, Kaga announced that instituting the desired changes had proven too difficult, and they had instead chosen to dissolve CyberFront effective immediately.\n\nAfter the announcement, most of the publisher's annouced titles were confirmed as canceled. The sole exception was Shin Tokyo Seiroku: Operation Abyss, which was merely delayed while other options for releasing it were being considered.\n\n",

The iPod contained several photos and a short video from \"The Hidden People\", a work done by cartoonist Graham Annable. In 2010, Telltale released Poker Night at the Inventory, a poker game featuring 4 different characters from four different franchises. The game combines Max, from the Sam & Max series of comic books and games (also from Telltale), Strong Bad from the Homestar Runner website, Heavy Weapons Guy from Valve's Team Fortress 2, and Tycho Brahe from the Penny Arcade web comic. Together with the player, they play no limits Texas Hold'em, while engaging in humorous conversations with each other. In December 2010 they released the first episode of Back to the Future: The Game. The planned Jurassic Park episodic series was supposed to debut soon after, but was delayed until November 2011. In April 2011 Telltale also released three episodes of Hector: Badge of Carnage, originally an iPhone/iPod Touch game by animation studio Straandlooper.\n\nLatest\n\nIn 2012 Telltale made Law & Order Legacies, based on the TV show.
